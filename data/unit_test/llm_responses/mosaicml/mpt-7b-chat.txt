==================


In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning the input data is already categorized or tagged with the correct output. The algorithm learns to recognize patterns in the input data and maps them to the correct output. The algorithm can then be used to predict the output for new, unseen input data.

In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset, meaning the input data is not categorized or tagged with the correct output. The algorithm is instead asked to find patterns or structure in the input data on its own. Common applications of unsupervised learning include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

The main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is that in supervised learning, the input data is labeled with the correct output, while in unsupervised learning, the input data is not labeled.
