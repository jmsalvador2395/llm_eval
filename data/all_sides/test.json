Bannon, Mr. Trump's chief strategist, as a \"supporter of an apocalyptic geopolitics\" that has stymied action against climate change and exploited fears of migrants and Muslims with calls for \"walls and purifying deportations.\" The article warns that conservative American Catholics have strayed dangerously into the deepening political polarization in the United States.

{"Key":"news49","Left":"Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) has mustered the 30 votes necessary to force a vote on the FCC's decision to repeal net neutrality. Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) announced that she's signed onto Markey's request to overturn the new rules, under the Congressional Review Act -- which lets Congress nullify recently passed regulations with a simple majority. Markey announced his intention to file a resolution of disapproval in December, just after the FCC voted on new rules that killed net neutrality protections from 2015. These new rules were officially published last week, and with 30 sponsors, Markey can make the Senate vote on whether to consider overturning them. If this happens, it would lead to a debate and final vote. That's not remotely the end of the process: if it's approved, the resolution will go to the House, and if it passes there, the desk of Donald Trump, who seems unlikely to approve it. And if it fails, it's not the only option on the table -- we've already heard about legal challenges and local legislation as well. But it keeps the fight for net neutrality running, and offers an immediate alternative to an \"open internet\" bill that doesn't restore the old protections.","Right":"Democratic lawmakers said Monday that they have enough support to force a Senate vote on repealing the Trump administration's rollback of \"net neutrality\" regulations. Still, the effort would be a long shot since it would require major Republican support to overcome White House opposition. \"A big step toward restoring a free and open Internet: with the support of @clairecmc, we now have the 30 votes we need to force a vote on my CRA to reverse the repeal of #NetNeutrality!\" Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., tweeted Monday, referring to Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., becoming the 30th co-sponsor to his Congressional Review Act legislation to roll back the Trump administration's action. The Federal Communications Commission, led by Chairman Ajit Pai, last month rolled back Obama-era rules that classified the Internet as a public utility required to treat all content, platforms, and sites equally. Net neutrality prevents service providers from blocking Internet traffic or charging different fees for services. Pai argued the Obama regulation limited competition and slowed investment in new networks, leaving consumers worse off. Critics contend the move gives too much power to larger providers. The move has been extremely controversial. Pai canceled an appearance at the annual Consumer Electronics Show Las Vegas on Tuesday following death threats directed at him over net neutrality. The Congressional Review Act allows a majority Congress to vote to rescind regulatory rules by federal agencies. The president can veto any CRA bill passed by Congress, but a veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers. There is bipartisan support in Congress for limiting the Trump administration's action, though it is not clear how strong the support for it is among Republicans.","Ahmed_Intersection":"Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) has mustered the 30 votes necessary to force a vote on the FCC's decision to repeal net neutrality.

The 8.1-magnitude quake triggered hundreds of aftershocks and a small tsunami near Salina Cruz in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. The largest waves were 1 meter high, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported. Thousands of residents in coastal areas, including the hard-hit state of Chiapas, were evacuated as a precaution. About 50 million people felt the tremor -- including those living in Mexico City, hundreds of miles from the quake's epicenter -- and nearly 2 million people lost power, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said. He offered his condolences to families of the deceased and warned more aftershocks could be yet to come. In 1985, Mexico was struck by a devastating but less powerful earthquake, which claimed thousands of lives and injured tens of thousands of people. \"We have experienced earthquakes before, but not like this. It was so intense,\" Chiapas resident Gonazalo Segundo, who was awoken by the disaster on Thursday, told CNN. \"I was already in bed. I was in my place, so we were expecting to have a tranquil night but suddenly ... everything breaks apart, glasses, furniture and everything.\" Meanwhile, Mexicans on the country's east coast are bracing for another potential crisis. Hurricane Katia, a Category 2 storm, is expected to strike the Gulf Coast in the state of Veracruz on Saturday morning. It could strengthen to a Category 3 storm by landfall and cause extreme flooding, analysts warn.

A compilation of shots from inside trembling buildings was tweeted out by Steve Rudin of ABC News. Utility pole transformers and lines sparked, showering the sidewalk and street in sparks.

He was right on both points. Mr. Comey explained that there was no clear evidence Mrs. Clinton or her colleagues had intentionally broken any federal laws on classified information, and he said that \"no reasonable prosecutor\" would pursue an indictment in the case.

The F.B.I. investigation, which began a year ago, examined tens of thousands of emails sent to and from Mrs. Clinton during her leadership of the State Department. It found that eight email threads contained information that was classified \"top secret\" at the time, the highest classification level. Several dozen more contained information that was either \"secret\" or \"confidential,\" the lowest level. For at least two reasons, Mr. Comey said, this did not amount to criminal wrongdoing. First was the lack of evidence that Mrs. Clinton or her colleagues had intended to break any laws. Second, prosecutions of similar cases in the past have relied on some combination of elements that were missing in this case: the intentional mishandling of classified information, indications of disloyalty to the United States, and efforts to obstruct justice.

The memorandum targets the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule that, when it begins to phase in April 10, would elevate all financial professionals dealing with retirement plans to the level of fiduciary, with increased ethics and legal duties that could effect the retirement accounts they offered and their relationship with clients. The Trump administration, siding with the financial services industry, said the rule will force advisers to limit the investment choices offered to clients. \"We think this was a complete miss on what they were trying to do. It has completely unintended consequences,\" a senior White House official said. \"It took away a huge amount of investment options.\" Supporters of the fiduciary rule argue that it protects consumers by requiring commission-based brokers and insurance agents to disclose conflicts of interest and forcing them to recommend the lowest cost 401(k) plans, individual retirement accounts or other retirement savings plans. The rule would affect more than $3 trillion of retirement assets in the U.S. Former President Barack Obama's administration estimated it would protect consumers who lose an estimated $17 billion a year from retirement investments due to advisor conflicts of interest. The Trump memorandum directs the labor secretary to delay implementation of the rule, review it and propose further action. \"They might determine that it is completely unnecessary,\" the official said.

Yet Andrew Puzder, the chief executive of the company that operates Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, has been chosen by President-elect Donald Trump as labor secretary. Here is the record at those restaurants. When the Obama Labor Department looked at thousands of complaints involving fast-food workers, it found labor law violations in 60 percent of the investigations at Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, usually for failure to pay the minimum wage or time and a half for overtime. Photo The central problem for workers today is persistently low pay, even at profitable companies with highly paid executives. Mr. Puzder, however, has been adamantly opposed to a meaningful increase in the federal minimum wage, which is $7.25 an hour. Mr. Trump has said he could stomach an increase to $10, which is still abysmal. Ideally, a labor secretary, who is supposed to have a deeper understanding of this issue, would push for much more. But Mr. Puzder has said that a big raise would mean fewer jobs for workers starting out. Even if that was true, and the evidence suggests otherwise, there are millions more who would benefit from raising the minimum wage. Mr. Puzder has also been a scathing critic of efforts by the Obama administration to update the rules for overtime-pay eligibility, which have not been fully adjusted for inflation since the mid-1970s. His argument boils down to an assertion that employees prefer a low salary and the \"prestige\" of a managerial title -- even though they would be entitled to overtime if they remained hourly employees. His opposition to the new overtime rules is especially troubling given that it would be his task as labor secretary to defend the rules, which have been challenged in court.

But getting a bitterly divided Senate to confirm him was an easy challenge compared with what comes next. Wray will have to convince government officials -- especially FBI employees -- and the general public that he will be an independent-minded leader and not a Trump lackey. He addressed this very issue during his confirmation hearing. \"I think the relationship between any FBI director and any president needs to be a professional one, not a social one,\" Wray said. Still, he will face skepticism when he walks into FBI headquarters on his first day. As my Vox colleague Dara Lind explains: Wray is a former Justice Department official. He ran the criminal division of the Department of Justice under George W. Bush, from 2003 to 2005. That means he has professional experience working with the FBI, though not experience working within it. FBI agents might see that as a crucial difference. They value their independence, which they feel is under attack from the White House. And they have reason not to trust that the Trump administration (and Trump family) is doing everything it can to help with the investigation. So Wray has his work cut out for him: not only proving himself to his new colleagues, but also overseeing the Russia investigation, which reaches all the way to the White House's power center. Yesterday, for example, the Washington Post reported that Trump dictated his son Donald Trump Jr.'s misleading response about the meeting he and other campaign officials had with a Kremlin-tied lawyer during the election. It remains to be seen if Wray will be able to do the job -- and for how long an anxious president will allow him to do it. One thing is for sure: Wray won't want to meet the same fate Comey did.

How much damage can a person do by staring at the sun for a few seconds? As many children are warned, there is indeed no \"safe\" amount of time to stare directly at the sun.

Most such solar, or photic, retinopathy is temporary, manifesting as spots in the visual field--like after a camera flashes in your eyes. Though in the case of solar damage, deficits in the visual field can last weeks, even months. Trump did later put on eclipse viewing-glasses.

You can thank Congress, the same people that can't even give us HCare!\" Trump tweeted. The accusation came after Trump signed the sweeping package of sanctions, which had passed both houses of Congress with a veto-proof majority. In signing the bill, Trump issued a written statement complaining that Congress was overstepping its constitutional bounds and impeding his ability to negotiate with foreign countries. The sanctions were answered with a stinging rebuke by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. TRUMP SIGNS RUSSIA SANCTIONS BILL He tweeted that the administration had shown \"total weakness by handing over executive power to Congress in the most humiliating way.\" In a Facebook tirade, he also said the legislation \"ends hopes for improving our relations with the new US administration.\" He seemed to acknowledge that Trump was pressured into signing the bill but went on to suggest it's all part of a sweeping process to ultimately oust him as president. \"The issue of new sanctions came about, primarily, as another way to knock Trump down a peg. New steps are to come, and they will ultimately aim to remove him from power. A non-systemic player has to be removed,\" he wrote. He added that \"relations between Russia and the United States are going to be extremely tense regardless of Congress' makeup and regardless of who is president.\" The breakdown in any sense of comity between Washington and Moscow follows Trump's high-profile meeting with President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Germany last month. At the time, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the two leaders \"connected very quickly\" and had \"positive chemistry,\" focusing on ways to move forward as opposed to \"relitigating\" the past. The sanctions bill, though, opens a new phase of tensions. The legislation is aimed at penalizing Moscow for election interference and for its military aggression in Ukraine and Syria, where the Kremlin has backed President Bashar Assad. It bars Trump from waiving the Russia sanctions without first securing approval from Congress, and also imposes new financial sanctions on Iran and North Korea.

On Tuesday, a San Francisco federal district court judge enjoined--that is, blocked--Trump's attack on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. This injunction is temporary, in place until the court rules on the substance--or the merits--of the challenge to Trump's plan to terminate DACA. The good news is by granting a preliminary injunction the judge has indicated that he thinks DACA's backers are likely to prevail. The bad news is that the injunction isn't complete. A federal judge in San Francisco issued a nationwide preliminary injunction Tuesday blocking the Trump administration's decision to phase out a program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation. The injunction by U.S. District Judge William Alsup says those protections must remain in place for the nearly 690,000 immigrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program while a legal challenge to ending the Obama-era program proceeds. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the decision to terminate the program on Sept. 5 and said no renewal applications would be accepted after Oct. 5. Under the administration's plan, permits that expired after March 5 could not be renewed. But Alsup ruled that while the lawsuit is pending, anyone who had DACA status when the program was rescinded Sept. 5 can renew it, officials said. The White House is in a rage over yet another defeat in court. (Granted, the threshold is low.) x New @PressSec statement on DACA injunction:","Right":"A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program on Tuesday, declaring that the Department of Homeland Security's \"decision to rescind DACA was based on a flawed legal premise.\" U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled the Obama-era program must remain in place while litigation plays out. Alsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, also said the program should continue, allowing those already approved for the program to renew their DACA protections and work permits. New applications will not be allowed to be submitted under the ruling, however. \"Dreamers' lives were thrown into chaos when the Trump Administration tried to terminate the DACA program without obeying the law,\" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. \"Today's ruling is a huge step in the right direction.\" \"America is and has been home to Dreamers who courageously came forward, applied for DACA and did everything the federal government asked of them,\" he added. \"They followed DACA's rules, they succeeded in school, at work and in business, and they have contributed in building a better America. We will fight at every turn for their rights and opportunities so they may continue to contribute to America.\" But the Department of Justice said the ruling doesn't change the facts about the program. \"DACA was implemented unilaterally after Congress declined to extend these benefits to this same group of illegal aliens.

Environmental groups widely condemned the selection of Tillerson as secretary of state. Exxon is facing multiple lawsuits over its role in covering up the science behind climate change. In 2015, InsideClimate News revealed how ExxonMobil's own research confirmed the role of fossil fuels in global warming decades ago. By 1977, Exxon's own senior experts had begun to warn the burning of fossil fuels could pose a threat to humanity. At first, Exxon launched an ambitious research program, outfitting a supertanker with instruments to study carbon dioxide in the air and ocean. But toward the end of the 1980s, Exxon changed course and shifted to the forefront of climate change denial. Since the 1990s, it has spent millions of dollars funding efforts to reject the science its own experts knew of decades ago. Tillerson has served as CEO and chairman of Exxon since 2006 and is known to have close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Wall Street Journal reports Tillerson has \"known Mr. Putin since he represented Exxon's interests in Russia during the regime of Boris Yeltsin.\" In 2013, Putin awarded Tillerson the country's Order of Friendship decoration. The news of Tillerson's selection comes a day after President Obama ordered a review of Russia's role influencing the presidential election.

{"Key":"news470","Left":"WASHINGTON -- Congress delivered a powerful rebuke to President Barack Obama on Wednesday by overriding his veto of a bill allowing 9\/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia for its alleged ties to the terrorist attacks. It's the first time one of Obama's vetoes has been overruled. It takes a two-thirds majority in the House and Senate to override a presidential veto, which is why it's so rare. In this case, both chambers had well above that threshold: The Senate voted 97-1 to override, and hours later, the House voted 348-77. The bill now automatically becomes law without the president's signature. Wednesday's vote brings an end to a monthslong scuffle between the White House and Congress over the measure known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. The bill prevents Saudi Arabia and other countries with alleged ties to terrorist groups from invoking their legal immunity in U.S. courts. It trumps the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which grants immunity to countries that aren't designated state sponsors of terrorism. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on 9\/11 were Saudi citizens, but the Saudi government denies any role in the attacks and multiple U.S. government investigations have cleared it of blame. Obama administration officials have warned that the bill would put U.S. service members overseas at legal risk and leave the United States vulnerable to bogus lawsuits in court systems around the world. The European Union and former top executive branch officials have urged Obama to stop it in the name of protecting sovereign immunity. Saudi Arabia has threatened to retaliate by selling off hundreds of billions of dollars in American assets. But those warnings just didn't sway lawmakers, who think the White House's case falls short. When the bill passed the House and Senate earlier this year, it sailed through both chambers with zero opposition. This is the single most embarrassing thing the United States Senate has done, possibly since 1983.

The subsidies have continued under Obama and Trump until now, despite prior Trump threats to block them. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats vowed to press for a bipartisan deal to restore the money by year's end. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi blasted Trump's move to end the payments as \"a spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of America.\" The decision is one of the most significant steps in Trump's bid to ultimately \"repeal and replace\" ObamaCare, and was expected to rattle already-unsteady insurance marketplaces.

DHS had temporarily waived the Jones Act -- an arguably outdated law that imposes exorbitant shipping costs on the U.S. island -- on Sept. 28. The waiver had meant that Puerto Rico had the option of importing food, fuel and supplies more quickly, and for half the cost, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. With the 1920 law back in effect, the island is now required to pay much higher costs to import supplies. The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by U.S.-owned and operated ships, which are more expensive vessels than others in the global marketplace. That's meant that Puerto Rico pays double the costs to import goods from the U.S. mainland compared with neighboring islands -- and that U.S. vessels are making bank. The return to higher shipping costs won't help Puerto Rico as it tries to climb out of economic devastation. Nearly half of the 3.4 million Americans on the island still don't have drinking water since Maria hit nearly three weeks ago. Just 15 percent have electricity. Many people still haven't heard from loved ones, and at least 39 deaths have been attributed to the storm.

Waiving the law allowed any ship to help get supplies to the island after two major hurricanes devastated it. The Trump administration was initially hesitant to grant the 10-day waiver to Puerto Rico, as it did for Texas and Florida after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. It justified its reluctance by saying American vessels were able to adequately serve the island. But it acted after from a request from Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello and pressure from lawmakers, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Experts say the law blocking foreign-flagged vessels imposes higher shipping costs on Puerto Rico than on other islands.

The nationwide preliminary injunction issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn mirrors a separate ruling handed down last month in California. Because the cancellation of DACA has already been halted, Garaufis' order won't have any immediate effect on Dreamers. But the second injunction marks a win for Trump's opponents, who have used the courts to defend DACA, even as the White House has sought to use the March 5 deadline set by the president as leverage to win concessions on border security from Democrats in Congress. It could also complicate Trump's own efforts in the courts. His administration has asked the Supreme Court to take the unusual step of overturning the first injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge William Alsup, now instead of letting it go through the normal appeals process. The Supreme Court could decide as soon as Friday whether it will hear the administration's request -- unless the new injunction delays that process. As of Tuesday, the justices were only scheduled to consider a request to overturn the injunction in the consolidated case out of California, according to Karen Tumlin, legal director for the National Immigration Law Center, one of the groups suing the administration over DACA. Trump declared he would rescind DACA in September, claiming it was unconstitutional. The White House aimed to terminate the program in phases, allowing recipients whose work permits and deportation protections would expire by March 5 to apply for renewal during a four-week window, but barring all new applicants. The plan was that Dreamers whose permits were set to expire after March 5 would be unable to apply for renewal, creating that deadline for Congress to act before","Right":"BY: Follow @cb0321 A federal judge ruled Tuesday that DACA participants are likely to succeed in their challenge to President Donald Trump's ending of the program, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from ending it.

Gascon's jurisdiction limits his reach here. Tens if not hundreds of thousands of other Californians unlucky enough to be arrested for weed elsewhere in the state will have to hope officials nearer to them follow his lead -- or find the money to pay a lawyer to petition the courts for an expungement. The San Francisco review will stretch back more than 40 years. More than 3,000 people convicted of a misdemeanor for marijuana possession will have their records erased, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Even a misdemeanor criminal record casts a long shadow in job interviews, the search for an apartment, and efforts to draw public benefits like unemployment insurance or food stamps. Gascon's decision to automate the expungement process will make it far easier for the predominantly black victims of the federal War on Drugs to benefit directly from the passage of Proposition 64, a ballot initiative that legalized marijuana in the state from the start of 2018. One state lawmaker is looking to automate the expungement process statewide through legislation, though the bill is vague and has not yet received a committee hearing date according to the state assembly website.

{"Key":"news230","Left":"Special counsel Robert Mueller has asked a grand jury in Washington, DC, to investigate Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, a major signal that the probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia is getting a whole lot bigger. As the Wall Street Journal reports, this means Mueller's probe has moved from simply investigating what might have happened to possibly charging people with crimes. That may not necessarily be an outcome, of course, but the fact that the investigation is widening means there is more Mueller deems worth looking into. The call for a grand jury is done for a specific purpose: so that prosecutors can subpoena documents they might not otherwise get, ensure witnesses testify under oath, and formally charge someone with a crime if they decide to. It's unlikely Mueller would have taken this step unless he felt there was a good reason to do so. And there is apparently good reason. CNN reports that the special counsel has found the financial ties between Trump associates and Russia to be among the most fruitful areas of investigation. There were signs something like this was coming. Since taking over the probe in May, Mueller has hired 16 lawyers with expertise in multiple areas including cybercrime, white-collar crime, and financial crime.

The paper called it \"a sign that his inquiry is growing in intensity.\" Perhaps. But there's less here than meets the eye. As an old Justice Department reporter, I can tell you this is utterly routine. Prosecutors regularly convene grand juries to question witnesses and gather evidence. It's what they do. The shocker would have been if Mueller completed his investigation without bringing in a grand jury. In fact, as the Journal story notes, there already was a grand jury, across the river in Alexandria, that the FBI was using in this case before Mueller was appointed. But in the public mind, \"grand jury\" is associated with \"indictment.\" And notwithstanding the old adage that a prosecutor can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich, the former FBI director could conclude that nothing in the case rises to an indictable offense--at least as far as the president and his inner circle. We have no way of knowing that, and neither does Mueller. The Washington Post reports that \"the development is a sign that investigators continue to aggressively gather evidence in the case.\" True.

HECTOR RETAMAL\/Getty Images On Wednesday, President Trump said he was not planning to waive or repeal Puerto Rico's inclusion in the Jones Act, the century-old law that restricts domestic shipping to U.S.-made, U.S.-owned, U.S.-staffed boats. Trump was responding to a growing chorus of politicians and activists calling for greater aid to the hurricane-stricken island, who have convincingly argued that the Jones Act drives up prices on the island by a factor of two compared to nearby Kingston, Jamaica. (For what it's worth, the Government Accountability Office study on the matter is a little more ambivalent.) Jones Act restrictions also inhibit the evolution of Puerto Rico's power system away from oil power, since most American tankers can't handle liquefied natural gas. Trump said he had hesitated to let foreign carriers carry mainland goods to Puerto Rico because \"a lot of people that work in the shipping industry... don't want the Jones Act lifted.\" On the one hand, the Jones Act is a pitch-perfect match for Trump's campaign rhetoric on buying and hiring American.

Enacted in 1920, the Jones Act prohibits tankers from hauling crude oil between U.S. ports unless those vessels are American-made, flagged and manned by a crew that is made up of 75 percent U.S. citizens. Democratic lawmakers were joined by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., on Tuesday in urging DHS to reconsider its decision. \"I am very concerned by the department's decision not to waive the Jones Act for current relief efforts in Puerto Rico, which is facing a worsening humanitarian crisis following Hurricane Maria,\" McCain wrote in a letter to Elaine Duke, acting DHS secretary. \"It is unacceptable to force the people of Puerto Rico to pay at least twice as much for food, clean drinking water, supplies and infrastructure due to Jones Act requirements as they work to recover from this disaster.\" McCain has long called for a repeal of the law, but the Jones Act enjoys strong","Ahmed_Intersection":"No plans to lift Jones Act to help relieve Puerto Rico as it recovers from Hurricane Maria.

San Francisco's board vote seems designed not so much to recognize Native Americans, as much as it is to erase Christopher Columbus from America's DNA. And on that score, the vote's not entirely surprising. Leftists have been chomping to strip Columbus from any seat of national honor for some time. In fact, the erasure of Columbus is just part and parcel of a steady progressive-fueled degradation of U.S. history that's been taking place for some time, hitting at everything from historical monuments to mountains.

The non-binding Paris accord, through which signatories pledge to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases over the coming decades, was brokered in 2015, when the annual conference was held in the French capital. The deal was considered historic because it was the first climate agreement to include the U.S. -- the world's biggest historic emitter, with by far the largest per-capita carbon footprint -- and China, which currently produces the most carbon pollution on a national level. The U.S. took a lead role in shaping the deal. Only war-torn Syria and Nicaragua, which protested the agreement's failure to impose strict demands on major polluters, refused to sign. But President Donald Trump, who rejects scientists' warnings about climate change, announced plans to withdraw from the pact in June, insisting developing nations received more benefits and the U.S. got none. In his announcement -- which, under the terms of the deal, fully can't go into effect until November 2020 -- Trump seemed to conflate the accord with a trade deal, demonstrating what was widely described as a poor understanding of how the Paris agreement actually works. \"Like the playground bully that eventually loses all his friends, Donald Trump has isolated himself on the world stage,\" Joe Ware,","Right":"Syria announced on Tuesday that it would be joining the Paris climate change agreement, leaving the United States as the only remaining country opposed to the deal after President Trump's June 1 decision to exit from the accord. \"There has been no change in the United States position on the Paris agreement,\" said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters in a statement to the Washington Examiner. \"As the president previously stated, the United States is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms more favorable for our country.\" The U.S. and Syria were the only remaining holdouts to the agreement after Nicaragua joined the Paris deal last month.

Add Interest A few weeks ago, a reporter noticed that video was missing from the State Department's website and asked the agency for an explanation. A spokesman at the time dismissed the incident as a \"technical glitch,\" saying that although the video was missing the transcript was never edited and complete versions of the video still existed in other government databases available to the public. Today, spokesman John Kirby admitted the edit was made deliberately, directed by unknown persons, and executed by a staffer in the technical department.

For Trump's backers in the oil industry, it's a big fat reward. One that will not only affect the balance of trade, and export oil jobs to Canada. Keystone XL would wipe out the U.S. trade surplus, and a hike in the price of oil to $75 or $80 a barrel would suddenly turn it to deficit.

On Tuesday, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Kenosha Unified School District in Wisconsin violated the rights of a trans student, Ash Whitaker, when it refused to let him use the boys' bathroom. According to the court, Whitaker is likely to win upon a full review of the case (instead of the current review of a lower court's preliminary injunction) on his claim that the school's actions violated Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination in schools based on sex, and the Equal Protections Clause of the 14th Amendment. So it upheld a lower court's injunction forcing the school to let Whitaker use the bathroom that aligns with his gender identity. In the decision, a three-judge panel from the Seventh Circuit Court concluded that the school district \"has failed to provide any evidence of how the preliminary injunction will harm it, or any of its students or parents\" -- a rebuke of the prevalent myth that letting trans people use the bathroom for their gender identity will hurt others. The ruling has big implications: If existing federal law and the 14th Amendment shield trans people from discrimination, then it's not just Whitaker's rights that are protected here, but all trans students'.

It wasn't just the decision to appoint a special counsel that raised eyebrows. It was also the person put into the job: Mueller, who spent his career in the FBI and who takes the post just weeks after Trump startled lawmakers and officials from both parties by abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey (who is also, incidentally, Mueller's close friend).

Some key obstacles, including the border wall and a standoff over subsidy payments to insurers under the Affordable Care Act, seemed to fall away as congressional negotiators worked on a deal. The White House said last week that it would continue to make the payments, and that message reassured Democrats who wanted to ensure that the payments, which go to insurers to lower deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income consumers, would not be cut off. Lawmakers were able to reach a resolution in the spending package on another potential sticking point, the fate of retired coal miners who faced losing their health coverage, an issue that brought lawmakers close to a government shutdown in December. The deal provides a permanent extension of health coverage for the retired miners. Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The proposed legislation has no funding for Trump's oft-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but does set aside $1.5 billion for border security measures such as additional detention beds. It does give Trump a $12.5 billion down payment on his request to strengthen the military, a figure which could rise to $15 billion should Trump present Congress with a plan for fighting the Islamic State terror group. The proposed $15 billion amounts to half of Trump's original $30 billion request. Trump said at nearly every campaign stop last year that Mexico would pay for the proposed 2,000-mile border wall, a claim Mexican leaders have broadly rejected. The White House sought nearly $1.4 billion in taxpayer dollars for the wall and related costs in the spending bill, but Trump later relented and said the issue could wait until September. With language about the border wall omitted, Democratic leaders praised the effort. \"The bill ensures taxpayer dollars aren't used to fund an ineffective border wall, excludes poison pill riders, and increases investments in programs that the middle class relies on, like medical research, education and infrastructure,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., echoed Schumer's praise, saying in a separate statement \"the omnibus does not fund President","Ahmed_Intersection":"Lawmakers created the government spending package agreement that cover until the end of the fiscal year to keep government running.

Saturday's Tax March, which took place in nearly 200 cities around the country, was unusual for a liberal protest both in its subject matter and its specificity: rather than focus on more typically leftist issues like police brutality, climate change or reproductive rights, the Tax March was all about taxes, which is typically a rallying cry of Republicans. Specifically, the marchers had just one demand: to see Trump's taxes. Most of the protests were largely conflict-free, but at least a dozen demonstrators were arrested in Berkeley after a pro-Trump demonstration resulted in a fistfight against counter-demonstrators, punctuated with pepper and smoke bombs.

The attacks constituted one of the deadliest days of violence against Christians in Egypt in decades and presented a challenge to the authority of the country's leader, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who promptly declared a three-month state of emergency. Security is the central promise of Mr. Sisi, a strongman leader who returned on Friday from a triumphant visit to the United States, where President Trump hailed him as a bulwark against Islamist violence. Mr. Trump made it clear that he was willing to overlook the record of mass detention, torture and extrajudicial killings during Mr. Sisi's rule in favor of his ability to combat the Islamic State and defend minority Christians. On Sunday, Mr. Sisi found himself back on the defensive, deploying troops to protect churches across the country weeks before a planned visit by Pope Francis.

It's not a perfect deal, but it repeals House Bill 2 and begins to repair our reputation.\" Gay rights advocates were harshly critical of the bill.

Doing so could jeopardize Democrats' influence over the inquiry and, importantly, their access to intelligence on possible ties between Trump associates and Moscow. The House Intelligence Committee is running one of the three investigations into Russian interference in the election, and possible ties between Trump associates and Russia. The Senate Intelligence Committee is running its own inquiry, and the F.B.I. has carried out a broad counterintelligence investigation since July. By most accounts, the Senate and F.B.I. investigations remain on track, unlike the House inquiry, which appears to have increasingly descended into a sideshow since its first public hearing a week ago. That was when James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I., publicly disclosed the bureau's investigation for the first time. Days later, Mr. Nunes made his first disclosure about Mr. Trump or his associates being caught in American intelligence gathering, prompting critics to argue that he was trying to shift attention and provide an assist to the White House at a crucial moment. The revelation that Mr. Nunes had viewed intelligence materials on White House grounds the day before bolstering the administration's case fueled damaging speculation that he was acting at the instruction of the president. That could prove fatal to the bipartisan investigation, which has hinged on the ability of Mr. Nunes to conduct a neutral inquiry while maintaining the trust and cooperation of Mr. Schiff.

Preet Bharara, 48, revealed his firing on his personal Twitter account. Several hours later, it was learned President Donald Trump had reached out through a secretary on his staff to Bharara on Thursday but the two men never spoke. The attempted contact -- described by a person told about the conversations who requested anonymity -- continued the unusual dynamic between Trump and the high profile prosecutor that stretched to Nov. 30, when Bharara emerged from a Trump Tower meeting with Trump to say the then-president-elect had asked him to stay on the job. The person who requested anonymity because of the talks' private nature said the secretary late Thursday left a voicemail asking Bharara to call back. Bharara reported the call to Sessions' chief of staff, Joseph \"Jody\" Hunt, who agreed it was best that Bharara not speak directly with Trump, the person said. Bharara then called the White House, telling the secretary he had spoken to the Justice Department and it was agreed he and Trump should not speak.

Naturally, Donald Trump commemorated the event on his favorite social- media platform, retweeting the Drudge Report headline \"GREAT AGAIN: +235,000,\" while his chief of staff, Reince Priebus,tweeted \".@POTUS Trump delivers in first #JobsReport. 235,000 new jobs and unemployment rate down to 4.7%. Great news for American workers!\" What Team Trump didn't mention, though, was that in February 2016, the U.S. added 237,000 jobs and in February 2015, it added 238,000, accomplishments for which Trump was loathe to give Barack Obama credit. Doing so would throw a wrench in Team Trump's narrative, that under his predecessor, the country was a post-apocalyptic wasteland where the unemployment rate was 42 percent. Unfortunately, not everyone in the administration got the memo that presumably read \"ANYTHING POSITIVE THAT HAPPENS MUST BE ATTRIBUTED TO TRUMP, NO EXCEPTIONS!\" And that someone was National Economic Council director Gary Cohn. Per Business Insider: During an interview with CNBC, Cohn said the report was \"right exactly where it needed to be,\" but he also said that Trump's team wasn't the reason for the beat. For one thing, Cohn said, the jobs that were promised by C.E.O.s who have met with Trump haven't been created yet. \"Look, there's clearly a good February as part of the number. I'm not going to deny that,\" Cohn said. \"But on the other hand, when you look at what we've been doing here at the White House and all of the C.E.O.s that we've brought in--whether it be Exxon or Sprint","Right":"President Trump, who as a candidate often criticized the government's jobs' reports during the Obama administration as \"phony,\" became a believer on Friday. The Labor Department, now part of the Trump administration, reported Friday that employers added 235,000 jobs in Mr. Trump's first full month in office, and the unemployment rate dropped slightly to 4.7 percent. A grinning White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he specifically asked the president Friday morning if he believed the new jobs report. \"They may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now,\" Mr. Trump told his spokesman. After the New Hampshire Republican primary last year, Mr. Trump said, \"Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.\" Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the strong hiring numbers in February were due to the policies of the previous administration. \"Thanks, Obama!\" he said. Mr. Spicer said Mr. Trump's actions clearly are having an impact with employers.

Trump made the accusation in a series of early morning tweets just weeks into his administration and amid rising scrutiny of his campaign's ties to Russia. \"How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon\/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!,\" Trump wrote in one tweet. \"I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!\" The remarkable tussle between the current and former presidents just 45 days since the handover of power is the latest twist in a controversy over ties between Trump associates and Russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trump's favor. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. Trump has accused officials in Obama's administration of trying to discredit him with questions about Russia contacts. Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said it had been a \"cardinal rule\" of the Obama administration that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. \"Neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S.","Right":"President Trump's early Saturday morning tweeting has exploded to the forefront an uncovered scandal I've been talking about since early January (including in this weekend's column): The fact that the Obama Justice Department and the FBI investigated associates of Donald Trump, and likely Trump himself, in the heat of the presidential campaign. To summarize, reporting indicates that, prior to June 2016, the Obama Justice Department and FBI considered a criminal investigation of Trump associates, and perhaps Trump himself, based on concerns about connections to Russian financial institutions. Preliminary poking around indicated that there was nothing criminal involved. Rather than shut the case down, though, the Obama Justice Department converted it into a national-security investigation under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). FISA allows the government, if it gets court permission, to conduct electronic surveillance (which could include wiretapping, monitoring of e-mail, and the like) against those it alleges are \"agents of a foreign power.\" FISA applications and the evidence garnered from them are classified - i.e., we would not know about any of this unless someone had leaked classified information to the media, a felony. Advertisement In June, the Obama Justice Department submitted an application that apparently \"named\" Trump in addition to some of his associates.
