The charges against Manafort are unrelated to the 2016 presidential election, but they are part of the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the election by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nManafort is accused of hiding millions of dollars in income from the IRS, as well as using shell companies to launder money. He is also accused of defrauding banks by lying about his financial assets.\n\nManafort has pleaded not guilty to all charges. His trial is scheduled to begin in September 2018.\n\nThe indictment against Manafort is a major development in the Mueller investigation. It is the first time that Mueller has charged anyone with a crime related to the investigation. The charges against Manafort are serious, and they could potentially lead to jail time.\n\nThe indictment is also a setback for Trump, who has repeatedly praised Manafort and called him a \"good man.\" The charges against Manafort could cast doubt on Trump's judgment, and they could also raise questions about his campaign's ties to Russia.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the indictment against Manafort will play out.

Some people have praised the article for its frankness and honesty, while others have criticized it for its negative portrayal of conservative American Catholics.\n\nWhether or not you agree with the article's conclusions, it is important to understand the context in which it was written. Pope Francis has been a vocal critic of what he sees as the \"idolatry of money\" and the \"culture of exclusion\" that he believes is prevalent in many parts of the world. He has also spoken out against the \"indifference\" of many Christians to the suffering of the poor and marginalized.\n\nIn light of these concerns, it is not surprising that Pope Francis would be critical of conservative American Catholics who, in his view, have allied themselves with Donald Trump and his policies. Trump has been accused of racism, sexism, and xenophobia, and his policies have been seen by many as harmful to the poor and vulnerable.\n\nOf course, not all conservative American Catholics support Trump or his policies. However, the article's authors argue that the alliance between conservative American Catholics and Trump is a dangerous one, and that it threatens to undermine the Catholic Church's mission to promote peace, justice, and compassion.\n\nWhether or not you agree with the article's conclusions, it is important to remember that the Catholic Church is a global institution with a wide range of views. There is no single \"correct\" way to be a Catholic, and there is always room for debate and discussion."}

Five states, including Texas and California, denied that they ever suffered attacks.

She declined to go into further detail about the classified information but said there was \"no doubt\" the Russian government was behind the attacks.

Five states, including Texas and California, denied that they ever suffered attacks. Jeh Johnson, who was DHS secretary at the time, told NBC that states and the federal government should 'do something about it,' though he lamented many of the targeted states haven't taken action since the election. Manfra disagreed, claiming that 'they have all taken it seriously.' Several of these states, meanwhile, told NBC that the help they sought from the federal government didn't come soon enough. Some state officials said they didn't possess the right clearance level to properly communicate the details of the threats they faced -- an issue Manfra said is now being handled. Other states said they hadn't received any assistance from DHS. Russian targeting of voter registration databases became known in the months leading up to the election, when the FBI warned state governments that hackers had infiltrated the Illinois State Board of Elections and attempted to do the same in Arizona. The head of cybersecurity at the Department of Homeland Security revealed Wednesday that Russia managed to hack into voter registration rolls of several states during the 2016 presidential election. U.S. intelligence official Jeanette Manfra told NBC News her department saw a small number of states where Moscow was 'successfully' able to hack voters systems, despite there being no evidence that registration rolls were altered in anyway. 'We saw a targeting of 21 states and an exceptionally small number of them were actually successfully penetrated,' she said. She declined to go into further detail about the classified information but said there was 'no doubt' the Russian government was behind the attacks. Her comments came the same week Secretary of State Rex Tillerson confirmed that hackers were already targeting the upcoming midterm elections. 'I think it's important we just continue to say to Russia, 'Look, you think we don't see what you're doing. We do see it and you need to stop. If you don't, you're going to just continue to invite consequences for yourself,'' Tillerson told Fox News. Following the 2016 presidential election, U.S. intelligence officials noted Russia's deliberate attempts to undermine American democracy by influencing voters across social media platforms. A special counsel was appointed shortly after to look into possible collusion between the Trump camp and Moscow.

The earthquake was the strongest to hit Mexico in a century, and it caused widespread damage and loss of life. The epicenter of the earthquake was located about 70 miles off the coast of the Mexican state of Oaxaca, and it was felt in Mexico City and other parts of the country. The earthquake caused buildings to collapse, roads to buckle, and power outages to occur. At least 98 people were killed in the earthquake, and more than 200 were injured. The earthquake also caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and hospitals. The Mexican government has declared a state of emergency in several affected states, and it is working to provide relief to those who have been affected by the earthquake.\n\nThe earthquake was caused by the movement of tectonic plates along the Cocos Plate and the North American Plate. The Cocos Plate is a tectonic plate that is moving eastward, while the North American Plate is moving westward. When these two plates collide, the Cocos Plate is subducted under the North American Plate. This subduction process causes stress to build up along the fault line, and when the stress is released, an earthquake occurs.\n\nThe earthquake that struck Mexico on September 7, 2017, was a reminder of the seismic activity that is common in the region. Mexico is located on the Ring of Fire, a geologically active belt that surrounds the Pacific Ocean. The Ring of Fire is home to more than 75% of the world's active volcanoes, and it is also where most of the world's earthquakes occur. The earthquake that struck Mexico on September 7, 2017, was a reminder of the potential for destructive earthquakes in the region, and it is important for people living in seismically active areas to be prepared for earthquakes.\n\nThere are a number of things that people can do to prepare for an earthquake. These include:\n\n* Creating a disaster preparedness plan\n* Having a survival kit on hand\n* Learning about earthquake safety procedures\n* Making sure your home is structurally sound\n* Having earthquake insurance\n\nBy taking these steps, people can reduce their risk of injury or death in an earthquake."}

'Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at, but my non-dealings are?' Trump said on his Twitter account Thursday afternoon. 'Crooked H destroyed phones w\/ hammer, 'bleached' emails, & had husband meet w\/AG days before she was cleared- & they talk about obstruction?' Trump said in a second tweet.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2017 The president's tweets come after it was reported Wednesday that Robert Mueller, special counsel for the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, is now investigating Trump for obstruction of justice. Trump criticized the news earlier Thursday, calling the investigation a 'witch hunt' and arguing his political opponents are making up allegations in order to undermine and bring down his presidency. In a briefing with reporters Thursday, deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump's tweets were likely prompted by 'some developments' in the Russia probe. Trump has long maintained the while the media has been focused on the investigation into his campaign's ties to Russian officials, news outlets are missing the 'big story' -- the Obama administration's 'unmasking and surveillance' of Americans.","system_text":null,"response":"President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for investigations into Hillary Clinton and the Democrats' alleged ties to Russia, despite the fact that there is no evidence to support such allegations. In fact, the FBI and the Department of Justice have both concluded that Clinton's use of a private email server was not illegal, and that there is no evidence that she colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump's attacks on Clinton and the Democrats are nothing more than a distraction from the real issue at hand: his own potential involvement in obstruction of justice. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Trump attempted to obstruct the FBI's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but his tweets and public statements suggest that he is concerned about the investigation.\n\nTrump's attacks on Clinton and the Democrats are also a way for him to rally his base and deflect attention from the Russia investigation. His supporters are eager to see Clinton brought down, and Trump's tweets give them hope that this will happen. By focusing on Clinton, Trump is able to keep his supporters on his side and avoid talking about the Russia investigation.\n\nTrump's attacks on Clinton and the Democrats are nothing more than a smokescreen. He is trying to distract from the real issue at hand: his own potential involvement in obstruction of justice. The American people should not be fooled by his lies and deflections."}

Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey opened and closed his statement to the press Tuesday with expressions of gratitude and pride to be associated with the bureau. His description of FBI agents' work on the Hillary Clinton email investigation showed why he feels that way. Whether the rest of his statement--explaining why he wasn't recommending prosecution of Mrs. Clinton--should make the feeling mutual is an open question. The agents had to reconstruct thousands of emails from a series of private servers...","system_text":null,"response":"James Comey's statement on the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server was a mixed bag. On the one hand, he announced that the FBI would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton, which is a relief for her and her supporters. On the other hand, he also said that Clinton was \"extremely careless\" in her handling of classified information, which is a damaging indictment of her judgment.\n\nComey's decision not to recommend charges is likely to be controversial. Some people will argue that Clinton's actions were reckless and that she should be held accountable, even if she did not break the law. Others will argue that Comey made the right call, given the lack of evidence that Clinton intended to break the law.\n\nUltimately, whether Comey's decision will hurt or help Clinton in the election is a matter of speculation. It is certainly possible that some voters will be turned off by her handling of the email server, but it is also possible that they will be more forgiving given the lack of criminal charges. The election is still a long way off, and much could happen between now and then.\n\nIn the meantime, Comey's statement has raised important questions about the handling of classified information. It is clear that Clinton's actions were not in line with the government's guidelines, and it is worth asking whether the guidelines need to be changed. It is also worth asking whether the FBI's investigation was thorough enough. Only time will tell what the full impact of Comey's statement will be, but it is sure to be a topic of discussion for many months to come."}

'This bill would make sweeping cuts to the Medicaid program, which has been a staple for 50 years,' Collins said Sunday on ABC's 'This Week with George Stephanopoulos.' McCain and eight others have expressed doubts about the bill and if they vote 'no,' it will fail. With the vote now tabled, there's even more pressure on lawmakers to deliver on something many of them have promised for years: repealing and replacing Obamacare, which they warn is collapsing. Some say if this bill doesn't pass, they'll have to come up with a different plan.","system_text":null,"response":"John McCain's absence from the Senate due to surgery has delayed the vote on the Better Care Act, a Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The bill is facing opposition from some Republicans, including Rand Paul and Susan Collins, who believe it does not go far enough in repealing Obamacare. With McCain's absence, McConnell needs the support of all 50 Republican senators to pass the bill. If the bill fails, Republicans will have to come up with a different plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nThe delay in the vote gives opponents of the bill more time to mobilize against it. They are arguing that the bill would make it harder for people to get health insurance, especially those with pre-existing conditions. They are also saying that the bill would cut funding for Medicaid, which provides health insurance to low-income people.\n\nSupporters of the bill say that it would lower premiums for many people and give states more flexibility in how they administer their health insurance programs. They argue that the bill would make it easier for people to shop for health insurance and would provide more choices for consumers.\n\nThe vote on the Better Care Act is still uncertain. It is possible that the bill could pass, but it is also possible that it could fail. If the bill fails, Republicans will have to come up with a different plan to repeal and replace Obamacare."}

Hannity did not ask any tough questions, and he did not challenge Trump Jr. on any of his statements. Instead, Hannity used the opportunity to praise Trump Jr. and to attack the media. Hannity called the media \"overpaid, lazy, rigid, left-wing ideologues\" and said that they had \"zero credibility left.\"\n\nHannity's interview with Trump Jr. was widely criticized by the media. Critics accused Hannity of being a propagandist for Trump and of being willing to sacrifice his journalistic integrity in order to defend the president. Some critics also accused Hannity of violating journalistic ethics by interviewing Trump Jr. before he had had a chance to speak with the Special Counsel's Office.\n\nDespite the criticism, Hannity's interview with Trump Jr. was a ratings success. The interview was watched by an estimated 4.2 million people, making it the most-watched cable news program of the week. The interview also generated a great deal of discussion on social media, with many people expressing their support for Trump Jr. and their outrage at the media.\n\nThe interview with Trump Jr. is just the latest example of Hannity's use of his platform to defend Trump and to attack the media. Hannity's willingness to sacrifice his journalistic integrity in order to support Trump raises serious questions about the future of journalism in America."}

In July 2016, Wasserman Schultz resigned from the DNC chair position amid allegations of bias and after leaked emails showed that she had been critical of Sanders and his supporters.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign from her position as DNC chair. First, she was accused of favoritism towards Hillary Clinton during the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries. Sanders supporters alleged that Wasserman Schultz had rigged the primaries in Clinton's favor, and that she had been biased against Sanders. These allegations were damaging to the DNC and to the Democratic Party as a whole.\n\nSecond, Wasserman Schultz was criticized for her handling of the Nevada Democratic caucuses. After Sanders won the caucuses, there were allegations of voter suppression and intimidation. Wasserman Schultz initially defended the Nevada Democratic Party, but later apologized for her handling of the situation.\n\nThird, Wasserman Schultz was criticized for her role in the release of hacked DNC emails. The emails, which were released by WikiLeaks, showed that Wasserman Schultz and other DNC officials had been critical of Sanders and his supporters.

Graham's statement suggests that even some of Trump's allies in Congress are beginning to worry about the president's behavior and its potential consequences.\n\nThe potential consequences of Trump firing Mueller are significant. Mueller is leading a wide-ranging investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. If Trump were to fire Mueller, it would be seen as a direct attempt to obstruct the investigation. This could lead to impeachment proceedings against Trump, or even to his resignation.\n\nGraham's statement is also significant because it comes at a time when Trump is under increasing pressure from Democrats and some Republicans to release his tax returns. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, claiming that he is under audit by the IRS. However, many people believe that Trump is simply trying to hide something from the public.\n\nIf Trump were to fire Mueller, it would likely increase pressure on him to release his tax returns. This is because it would be seen as a further attempt by Trump to obstruct justice. If Trump were to release his tax returns, it would give the public a clearer picture of his finances and his ties to Russia. This could potentially damage Trump's presidency and even lead to his impeachment."}

However, there are a number of possible explanations.\n\nOne possibility is that Trump was motivated by a desire to appease conservative voters who are opposed to transgender rights. Trump has a history of making statements that are hostile to the LGBTQ community, and he may have felt that banning transgender people from the military would be a way to gain support from these voters.\n\nAnother possibility is that Trump was concerned about the cost of providing medical care to transgender service members. A 2016 study by the Rand Corporation found that providing medical care to transgender service members would cost the military an estimated $8.4 million per year. This may have been a significant factor in Trump's decision, as he has repeatedly expressed concerns about the federal budget deficit.\n\nIt is also possible that Trump simply does not believe that transgender people are capable of serving in the military. In a series of tweets announcing the ban, Trump said that transgender people \"burden our military with tremendous medical costs and disruptions\" and that they \"cannot serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\" These statements suggest that Trump may believe that transgender people are not physically or mentally fit for military service.\n\nWhatever the reason for Trump's decision, it is clear that it has been met with widespread opposition. Many people, including transgender service members, veterans, and allies, have spoken out against the ban. They argue that it is discriminatory, unfair, and based on false stereotypes about transgender people.\n\nThe ban is currently being challenged in court, and it is unclear whether it will ultimately be upheld. However, it has already had a significant impact on the lives of transgender people who are serving or who want to serve in the military."}

For example, Wray has said that he believes in the importance of the FBI's independence, and that he would not be comfortable with the president interfering in its investigations. He has also said that he is not a fan of Trump's travel ban, and that he believes it is important to protect the rights of immigrants. These disagreements could make it difficult for Wray to work with Trump, and they could also make him a target of Trump's ire.\n\nIt remains to be seen how Wray will handle the Russia investigation\n\nThe Russia investigation is one of the most important issues facing the FBI right now, and it will be a major test for Wray's leadership. Wray has said that he will not interfere with the investigation, and that he will let the facts lead where they may. However, Trump has repeatedly attacked the investigation, and he has even called for the firing of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. It remains to be seen how Wray will respond to these attacks, and how he will protect the independence of the FBI.\n\nWray's confirmation is a mixed bag\n\nOverall, Wray's confirmation is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it is good news that the Senate was able to confirm someone to be the FBI director. This is important because the FBI is a vital institution, and it needs a strong leader. On the other hand, Wray's confirmation is also concerning because he has some significant disagreements with Trump. These disagreements could make it difficult for Wray to work with Trump, and they could also make him a target of Trump's ire. It remains to be seen how Wray will handle these challenges, and how he will fare as the new FBI director."}

For example, he stopped short of calling the violence \"terrorism,\" and he also condemned \"hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides.\" This latter statement is troubling, as it implies that there is some equivalency between the white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville and the counter-protesters who opposed them. In reality, there is no equivalency. The white supremacists were the aggressors, and they were responsible for the violence that erupted in Charlottesville.\n\nTrump's condemnation of white supremacists is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough. He needs to continue to speak out against hate and bigotry, and he needs to do so in a clear and unequivocal way. He also needs to make sure that his administration is taking steps to combat white supremacy and other forms of extremism. Only then will we be able to make progress in healing the divisions that have been exposed in Charlottesville."}

Trump has praised Arpaio as a \"good man\" and a \"great sheriff\" who has done a \"tremendous job\" on immigration.\n\nCritics of the pardon argue that it is an endorsement of Arpaio's discriminatory policies. Arpaio's deputies have been accused of racial profiling, unlawful detention, and excessive force. They have also been accused of targeting Latinos for traffic stops and other forms of harassment.\n\nThe pardon also undermines the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. By pardoning Arpaio, Trump is essentially saying that he does not believe that Arpaio should be held accountable for his actions. This sends a dangerous message that the president can pardon anyone he wants, regardless of whether they have broken the law.\n\nThe pardon has also been criticized for its timing. Trump pardoned Arpaio just days before his sentencing, which many see as an attempt to interfere with the judicial process. The pardon also comes at a time when Trump is facing criticism for his handling of the Charlottesville white supremacist rally.\n\nOverall, Trump's pardon of Arpaio has been widely condemned by both Democrats and Republicans. The pardon is seen as an endorsement of Arpaio's discriminatory policies, an undermining of the rule of law, and a politically motivated move."}

'President Trump is incredibly supportive of America's great service members who risk their lives every day to keep our country safe,' Sanders said in a statement. 'He has asked the Department of Defense to explore a celebration at which all Americans can show their appreciation.' Defense Department spokesman Thomas Crosson said the Pentagon is 'aware of the request and are in the process of determining specific details.

It could be seen as a waste of money, time, and resources. It could also be seen as a form of militarism or nationalism. And it could potentially provoke other countries to hold their own military parades.\n\nUltimately, whether or not to hold a military parade is a decision for the President and Congress to make. There are both pros and cons to consider, and the decision should be made on a case-by-case basis."}

However, it is not clear whether Trump would have a valid basis for invoking executive privilege in this case.\n\nIn order to invoke executive privilege, the president must show that the information he is seeking to withhold is confidential and that disclosure of the information would harm the national interest. In the case of Comey's testimony, it is not clear that Trump could meet these requirements. Comey's testimony is likely to focus on his conversations with Trump about the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. These conversations are already public knowledge, as Comey has already written memos about them. In addition, it is not clear that disclosure of these conversations would harm the national interest. In fact, disclosure of these conversations could actually help to shed light on the Russian interference investigation and could help to restore public confidence in the FBI.\n\nIf Trump does invoke executive privilege to prevent Comey from testifying, it is likely that the courts would have to decide whether Trump has a valid basis for doing so. The courts have generally been reluctant to second-guess the president's decisions about executive privilege, but they have also made clear that the privilege is not absolute.

This injunction is temporary, in place until the court rules on the substance--or the merits--of the challenge to Trump's plan to terminate DACA. The good news is by granting a preliminary injunction the judge has indicated that he thinks DACA's backers are likely to prevail. The bad news is that the injunction isn't complete. A federal judge in San Francisco issued a nationwide preliminary injunction Tuesday blocking the Trump administration's decision to phase out a program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation. The injunction by U.S. District Judge William Alsup says those protections must remain in place for the nearly 690,000 immigrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program while a legal challenge to ending the Obama-era program proceeds. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the decision to terminate the program on Sept. 5 and said no renewal applications would be accepted after Oct. 5.

It allows certain undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to apply for temporary protection from deportation and work permits. To be eligible for DACA, applicants must meet certain requirements, including having arrived in the United States before the age of 16, having lived in the United States continuously since June 15, 2007, and being currently in school or having graduated from high school or obtained a GED. As of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 700,000 people enrolled in DACA.\n\nIn September 2017, the Trump administration announced that it would be ending the DACA program. The administration argued that DACA was an unlawful exercise of executive power and that Congress should be the one to address the issue of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. However, several lawsuits were filed challenging the Trump administration's decision to end DACA. In January 2018, a federal judge in California issued a nationwide injunction blocking the Trump administration from ending the program. The judge ruled that the Trump administration had failed to follow proper procedures in ending DACA and that doing so would cause irreparable harm to the young immigrants who are protected by the program. The Trump administration appealed the injunction, but it was upheld by a federal appeals court in June 2018. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the Trump administration's appeal in June 2019.\n\nIn June 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that the Trump administration had not followed proper procedures in ending DACA. The Court's ruling did not require the Trump administration to reinstate the program, but it did allow DACA recipients to continue living and working in the United States while the program remains in legal limbo.\n\nThe Trump administration has continued to try to end DACA, but it has been unsuccessful. The Supreme Court's ruling in June 2020 was a major victory for DACA recipients and their advocates. It is unclear what will happen to DACA in the future, but the program is currently still in effect."}

He has been banned from entering the United States, and he believes that this is because of his work to expose corruption in Russia. Browder's visa was revoked after Russia added him to Interpol's wanted list, and he believes that this was a politically motivated move.\n\nBrowder is the founder of Hermitage Capital Management, a hedge fund that invested in Russia. He became a vocal critic of Putin after the Russian government seized his company's assets in 2005. Browder has since been working to expose corruption in Russia, and he has been a key figure in the Magnitsky Act, which sanctions Russian officials who are involved in human rights abuses.\n\nBrowder believes that his visa revocation is a retaliation for his work on the Magnitsky Act. He says that the Russian government is trying to silence him and prevent him from continuing his work. Browder has vowed to continue his work, and he says that he will not be intimidated by the Russian government.\n\nThe visa revocation is a significant setback for Browder, but it is unlikely to stop him from working to expose corruption in Russia. Browder is a determined and resourceful individual, and he has a strong network of supporters. He is likely to continue his work, even if he is unable to travel to the United States."}

This division is especially pronounced when it comes to Trump, who is a very polarizing figure. Many people on both sides of the political spectrum feel very strongly about Trump, and this can lead to anger and resentment.\n\nThe second factor is that Trump himself has made a number of inflammatory statements that have contributed to the anger and resentment towards him. For example, he has made derogatory comments about Mexicans, Muslims, and women. He has also called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. These statements have alienated many people and made them feel like Trump is a threat to their safety and well-being.\n\nThe third factor is the presence of social media. Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have made it very easy for people to share information and opinions with others. This can be a positive thing, but it can also be used to spread misinformation and hate speech. In the case of the Trump rally, social media was used to spread rumors and propaganda about the event, which may have contributed to the violence.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that there are always going to be some people who are simply looking for an excuse to riot. In this case, the Trump rally provided a perfect opportunity for these people to vent their anger and frustration.\n\nAll of these factors contributed to the violence outside the Donald Trump rally in San Diego.

Hyten, the commander of the U.S. Strategic Command who oversees America's nuclear arsenal, spoke at a forum titled 'Nukes: The Fire and the Fury,' as recorded in a video on the event's Facebook page. He didn't define what exactly would constitute an illegal launch order. But Hyten said he has been trained for the past 36 years in the law of armed conflict, and mentioned the consideration of such elements as proportional response and unnecessary suffering that would be caused by such a conflagration. In the event Trump suggests an illegal strike, Hyten described a scenario in which he would present Trump with legal choices. 'I provide advice to the president. He will tell me what to do,' Hyten said. 'And if it's illegal, guess what's going to happen? I'm going to say, 'Mr. President, that's illegal.' And guess what he's going to do? He's going to say, 'What would be legal?' And we'll come up with options... a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that's the way it works. It's not that complicated.' 'I think some people think Air Force Gen. John Hyten, the top U.S. nuclear commander, said he would decline an 'illegal' nuclear launch if President Donald Trump called for one, the Washington Examiner reported Saturday. Hyten, who is head of the U.S. Strategic Command, made the remarks at the Halifax International Security Forum in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Saturday. He is in charge of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 'I think some people think we're stupid. We're not stupid people. We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility, how do you not think about it?' Hyten said.

Congressional lawmakers have yet to renew federal funding for CHIP since the program expired on Sept. 30. Since then, state officials have had to relay devastating news of funding shortages to families of modest incomes right around the holidays. CHIP provides low-cost health coverage to nearly nine million children nationwide, and provides insurance to roughly 150,000 Alabama children, 84,000 of which are at risk of losing coverage through the state's CHIP, dubbed ALL Kids.

It has helped to reduce the number of uninsured children by more than half since it was created in 1997. CHIP also helps to improve children's health outcomes. Children who are covered by CHIP are more likely to have a regular doctor, to receive preventive care, and to be up to date on their vaccinations.\n\nThe funding crisis for CHIP is the result of political gridlock in Congress. Republicans and Democrats have been unable to agree on a way to reauthorize the program. Republicans want to make changes to CHIP, such as requiring states to work with Medicaid to provide coverage to more children. Democrats want to keep CHIP as it is, without any changes.\n\nThe funding crisis for CHIP is a serious problem. It threatens to deny health care to millions of children.

This could have a number of negative consequences, including higher rates of uncompensated care for hospitals and other health care providers, and increased financial hardship for individuals and families.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that the CSRs are illegal because Congress never appropriated the money to pay for them.

A lone gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, opened fire inside the First Baptist Church, killing 26 people and injuring at least 20 others. The shooting was the deadliest mass shooting in Texas since the 2015 San Bernardino attack, and the deadliest mass shooting in the United States since the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.\n\nKelley was a 26-year-old former US Air Force member who had been discharged from the service after a court-martial for assaulting his wife and stepson. He had a history of mental illness and was known to be a violent person.\n\nKelley opened fire at the church during a Sunday service. He was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and a handgun. He fired indiscriminately at the congregation, killing 26 people and injuring at least 20 others. He then fled the scene in a car, but was later pursued and killed by police.\n\nThe Sutherland Springs shooting was a tragedy that shocked the nation. It raised questions about gun control and mental health, and it sparked a debate about how to prevent future mass shootings.\n\nIn the wake of the shooting, President Donald Trump called for \"thoughts and prayers\" for the victims and their families. He also said that he would meet with lawmakers to discuss gun control.\n\nHowever, Trump has since downplayed the need for gun control, and he has said that he will not support any legislation that would restrict access to guns.\n\nThe Sutherland Springs shooting is a reminder of the dangers of gun violence in America. It is a tragedy that should not be forgotten. We must continue to work to prevent future mass shootings, and we must do everything we can to keep our communities safe.\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, there was a great deal of discussion about gun control. Some people argued that stricter gun control laws were needed to prevent future shootings, while others argued that the Second Amendment guaranteed the right to own guns and that any attempt to restrict gun ownership was an infringement on that right.\n\nThe debate over gun control is a complex one, and there are no easy answers. However, it is a debate that we must have in order to find ways to keep our communities safe."}

He has called Trump a \"narcissist\" and a \"demagogue\" and has said that the Republican Party has become \"the party of Trump.\" Endorsing Jones is a way for Flake to distance himself from the Republican Party and Trump.\n* Flake is also a critic of Roy Moore. He has called Moore \"unfit for office\" and has said that Moore's accusers should be believed. Endorsing Jones is a way for Flake to stand up to Moore and to send a message that sexual misconduct will not be tolerated.\n* Flake is retiring at the end of his term, so he has less to lose by endorsing Jones. He may feel that he can speak out against Trump and Moore without fear of political repercussions.\n* Flake may believe that Jones is the best candidate to represent Alabama in the Senate. Jones is a former federal prosecutor who has a reputation for being fair and impartial. He is also a moderate Democrat who may be able to appeal to some Republican voters.\n\nIt is too early to say whether Flake's endorsement will have a significant impact on the race.

Maybe there is. I don't know.\" Here are some of the excuses: He didn't mean that. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Trump meant voters \"have the power to campaign against her.\" According to CNN's Jeremy Diamond, Giuliani continued to say the media spun out a nonexistent thread toward shooting Clinton. \"I saw it, I heard it, I know what it meant,\" Giuliani said. \"I know how the crowd reacted to it.\" He was talking about gun control.

Trump surrogates and campaign staffers have offered a barrage of half-hearted excuses, ranging from the generic 'he was just saying go vote!' to blaming the media for making assumptions, since Trump's appearance earlier in the day in North Carolina.

Here are some of the excuses: He didn't mean that. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Trump meant voters 'have the power to campaign against her.' According to CNN's Jeremy Diamond, Giuliani continued to say the media spun out a nonexistent thread toward shooting Clinton. 'I saw it, I heard it, I know what it meant,' Giuliani said. 'I know how the crowd reacted to it.' He was talking about gun control.

However, this argument is also unconvincing. Trump did not mention anything about defending against a tyrannical government.

Trump has a history of making inflammatory remarks, and he often uses fear and intimidation as a political strategy. By suggesting that the Second Amendment people could \"stop\" Clinton, Trump was trying to make her supporters afraid of what might happen if she were elected president.\n\nTrump's comments are deeply troubling, and they have no place in American politics.

Critics argue that it undermines the Senate's role as a check on the power of the president, and that it makes it easier for presidents to appoint nominees who are not qualified or who have extreme views. Supporters argue that the nuclear option is necessary to prevent the minority party from blocking all presidential appointments, and that it is simply a matter of using the Senate's rules to achieve a desired outcome.\n\nThe nuclear option is likely to continue to be a source of debate in the United States Senate. It is a powerful tool that can be used to achieve important goals, but it also has the potential to damage the Senate and make it more difficult to reach consensus on important issues.\n\nIn the case of Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court, Democrats have threatened to filibuster the nomination. If they do, Republicans could use the nuclear option to break the filibuster and confirm Gorsuch with a simple majority vote. This would be a significant change to the Senate's rules, and it would likely have far-reaching consequences.

The Justice Department and the Education Department, in guidance directed at every American public school district, admonished educators to treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity, regardless of what sex is listed on student records. The guidance, which cites the gender equity law Title IX, further injects the federal government into a heated debate over controversial anti-LGBT state legislation, including a North Carolina law that bars transgender students from bathrooms that don't match their birth gender.

Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania introduced the bill in the House Tuesday amid ongoing controversy over President Donald Trump's mental stability. The 'Stable Genius Act' is an acronym for the Standardizing Testing and Accountability Before Large Elections Giving Electors Necessary Information for Unobstructed Selection Act, and pokes fun at Trump's recent tweet in which he referred to himself as a 'very stable genius.' You see how that works? The bill would require all presidential candidates to file a report with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), 'certifying that he or she has undergone medical examination by the medical office under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Navy,' according to CBS News. Trump's unhinged Twitter attacks, frequent off-the-cuff remarks, slurring and very peculiar drinking habits have led to some psychiatrists, mental-health experts and administration critics to call the president's mental stability into question, as the Salon video below notes. The publication of author Michael Wolff's new 'Fire and Fury' book provoked further questions. Wolff has recently suggested the 25th Amendment is discussed 'all the time' in the White House, as Salon has previously reported. ANALYSIS\/OPINION: There's an old biblical principle that goes like this: Don't try and pull the speck from another's eye without first removing the log from your own. Democrats, on an all-courts-press to paint President Donald Trump as a mental nutcase, would do well to remember this adage. It's not as if Democrats were the sanest people on planet earth. Think Black Lives Matter wielding baseball bats in the streets. But it's this, from Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Dem on the House Intelligence Committee, who said during a nationally televised CNN interview: 'We have a seriously flawed human being in the Oval Office.' Hmm. He also said, as Politico noted: 'I don't think there is anyone in Congress, frankly, of either party who does not concur at least privately with those observations and concerns.' Well frankly, this whole line of mental instability aimed at the president is both weak and tiresome. 'New scrutiny for Trump's mental fitness after book, tweets,' The Hill blasted in a headline, on the heels of the widely talked about salacious reporting of 'Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,' by Michael Wolff. And then this, from Newsweek: 'Trump Could Destroy the Entire Human Species, Says Yale Psychiatrist Who Warned Congress Members.' And the latest, this, from CNNPolitics: 'Trump physical unlikely to shed light on mental fitness.' Give it a rest, left. There's enough in the Democratic Party to wonder about your own sanity level. Can you say Bill Clinton, purported rapist, admitted adulterer? Clinton was ultimately impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice in 1998, but saved from Senate conviction by party loyalists. Hillary Clinton continues to face fire for alleged pay-for-play schemes involving her work while secretary at the State Department and simultaneous affiliation with the Clinton Foundation, and for","system_text":null,"response":"The 'Stable Genius Act' is a piece of legislation introduced by Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania that would require aspiring U.S. presidents to undergo a mental-health examination and release medical records prior to elections. The bill has been met with mixed reactions, with some arguing that it is a necessary step to ensure the mental fitness of our nation's leaders, while others argue that it is an invasion of privacy and that there are other ways to assess a candidate's mental fitness.\n\nThere are a number of arguments in favor of the 'Stable Genius Act.' First, it would allow voters to make an informed decision about who they are electing to the highest office in the land. If a candidate has a mental illness that could impact their ability to serve as president, voters should be aware of that before casting their ballots. Second, the act would help to protect the country from a president who is mentally unfit to serve. If a president becomes mentally ill while in office, it could have disastrous consequences for the nation. The 'Stable Genius Act' would ensure that there is a process in place to remove a president who is no longer mentally capable of serving.\n\nHowever, there are also a number of arguments against the 'Stable Genius Act.' First, it is an invasion of privacy. Candidates have a right to keep their medical records private, and the government should not be able to force them to release them. Second, the act is discriminatory. It would only apply to presidential candidates, not to other elected officials or members of the public. This is unfair, and it could lead to discrimination against people with mental illness. Finally, the act is unnecessary. There are already other ways to assess a candidate's mental fitness, such as interviews and psychological evaluations. The 'Stable Genius Act' is not necessary, and it would be better to focus on other ways to improve the quality of our nation's leaders.\n\nOverall, the 'Stable Genius Act' is a controversial piece of legislation with a number of pros and cons. It is important to weigh the arguments on both sides carefully before deciding whether or not you support the act."}

In January 2017, Trump tweeted that McConnell was \"a do-nothing Senator who has accomplished nothing.\" In April 2017, Trump said that McConnell was \"a failure\" and that he was \"not capable\" of leading the Senate.\n\nMcConnell has been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for his handling of the healthcare reform bill. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives in May 2017, but it failed to pass the Senate in July 2017. McConnell has been blamed for the bill's failure, as he was the Senate majority leader and was responsible for bringing the bill to a vote.\n\nTrump has also been frustrated with McConnell's failure to advance other parts of his agenda, such as tax reform and infrastructure spending. In June 2017, Trump said that McConnell was \"holding up\" tax reform. In July 2017, Trump said that McConnell was \"not doing enough\" to get infrastructure spending passed.\n\nTrump's criticism of McConnell is likely to continue, as the two men have very different styles of leadership.

The campaign has taken a number of steps since election day to review election results and has not found 'any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology,' Marc Elias, the campaign's general counsel, wrote in a statement on Medium. The campaign had not planned to call for a recount, Elias wrote, but now that one is underway, it felt an obligation to participate. The extent of the campaign's participation was not immediately clear. 'Now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,' Elias wrote. 'If Jill Stein follows through as she has promised and pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, we will take the same approach in those states as well.' Stein filed for a recount in Wisconsin on Friday after quickly raising more than $5 million to challenge election results there and in Michigan and Pennsylvania -- all key states that Clinton lost in the presidential election. Stein's call for a recount came after data scientists publicly raised questions about discrepancies in election results. Elias wrote that the Clinton campaign had been consulting with a number of experts to understand irregularities in election result data and had attempted to 'systematically catalogue and Sen. Bernard Sanders on Sunday dismissed the presidential vote recount in Wisconsin, saying 'nobody cares' about it and that it's unlikely to affect the outcome of the election in any way. Speaking on CNN's 'State of the Union,' the Vermont independent and former presidential hopeful said the recount, while perfectly justified, simply is not a big deal. 'It's taking place. The Green Party has the legal right to do it ... No one expects there to be profound change, but there's nothing wrong with going through the process,' Mr. Sanders said, going on to throw cold water on any notion that the result in Wisconsin could change. 'This is exactly the issue -- nobody cares,' he said. 'I don't think Hillary Clinton, who got 2 million more votes than [President-elect Donald] Trump in the popular election, thinks it's going to transform the election. But do people have the legal right to do it? Yeah, we do.' Mr. Trump narrowly defeated Mrs. Clinton in the state, garnering 1404,000 votes to 1,381,823 for the former first lady, according to the Wisconsin Election Commission. The recount has been spearheaded by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who raised millions of dollars for the effort in just a few days.

The campaign also wanted to be transparent and show that they were willing to participate in a recount even though they were confident that they had won the election.\n\nThe recount in Wisconsin was initiated by Green Party nominee Jill Stein. Stein raised millions of dollars to fund the recount, and she argued that there was evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election. However, there was no evidence to support her claims, and the recount did not change the outcome of the election.\n\nThe recount in Wisconsin was a costly and time-consuming process.

There's a breakfast and what the White House calls a listening session with business leaders in the morning; another listening session with union leaders and workers in the afternoon; and a reception later on with the members of Congress he'll need on board to overhaul the nation's health care system, among other goals. He'll also hold his first meeting as president with the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. The outreach effort comes after a tumultuous first weekend in the White House that included lambasting news organizations for correctly reporting on the size of the crowds at his inauguration and mass protests against his presidency on the following day. Trump delivered a more unifying message Sunday and sought to reassure Americans he was up to the daunting task ahead. Speaking in the White House East Room during a swearing-in ceremony for top aides, the president warned his staff of the challenges ahead but declared he believed they were ready. 'But President Donald Trump begins his first week in office with a busy schedule of meetings and executive orders. The president will begin the week by hosting a breakfast for key business leaders, where he plans to listen to their advice and concerns in his administration. 'Busy week planned with a heavy focus on jobs and national security,' Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday morning. 'Top executives coming in at 9:00 A.M. to talk manufacturing in America.' The president has already signaled his plans to meet with the Prime Minister of Canada and the president of Mexico to discuss renegotiating NAFTA.

Trump reportedly discussed his plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, as well as his plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump also signed several executive orders during his first week in office. One of his first orders was to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. He also signed orders to begin the process of building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, to ban refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, and to order the Department of Homeland Security to review its vetting procedures for refugees and immigrants.\n\nTrump's first week in office was a busy one, and he set the tone for his presidency by taking action on a number of his campaign promises. It remains to be seen whether Trump will be able to achieve his goals, but he has certainly gotten off to a fast start."}

They also argue that Columbus Day is a celebration of colonialism and white supremacy, and that Indigenous Peoples' Day is a more accurate and inclusive way to recognize the contributions of Native Americans to American history.\n\nThose who oppose renaming the holiday argue that Columbus is a historical figure who should be remembered, regardless of his flaws. They also argue that Columbus Day is a day for Italian-Americans to celebrate their heritage, and that renaming the holiday would be an attack on their culture.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to rename Columbus Day is a matter of personal opinion. There is no right or wrong answer, and each person must decide for themselves what they believe is the best way to honor the history of both Christopher Columbus and the Native Americans who were already living in North America when he arrived.\n\nIn my opinion, it is important to remember the history of both Christopher Columbus and the Native Americans who were already living in North America when he arrived. Columbus was a complex figure who played a significant role in world history, both positive and negative. Native Americans are the original inhabitants of North America, and their history and culture is just as important as that of any other group of people. I believe that both Columbus Day and Indigenous Peoples' Day can be valuable opportunities to learn about and celebrate the history of both of these groups."}

The protests turned violent on Thursday and Friday, with demonstrators smashing shop windows, torching vehicles, and clashing with police. At least 160 police officers were injured, and 80 people were arrested. The protests have also caused significant damage to property in the city.\n\nThe protests are being seen as a backlash against the G20, which is seen by many as a symbol of global capitalism. The G20 is an intergovernmental forum that brings together the leaders of the world's 20 largest economies. The forum is designed to discuss issues such as economic growth, climate change, and terrorism.\n\nThe protests are also being seen as a reflection of the growing discontent with the political establishment in many countries. In recent years, there has been a rise in support for populist and nationalist movements, which have often been critical of the G20.\n\nThe violence at the G20 summit is a reminder of the challenges that the forum faces. The G20 is a powerful body, but it is also a fragile one. The summit in Hamburg has shown that the G20 is vulnerable to protests and unrest. The forum will need to find ways to address the concerns of those who are protesting against it, or it risks becoming increasingly marginalized.\n\nThe G20 summit in Hamburg has been a major test for the forum. The violence and unrest that have marred the summit have shown that the G20 is not immune to the challenges that are facing the world today. The forum will need to find ways to address these challenges if it is to remain relevant."}

The announcement came at the 23rd Conference of the Parties in Bonn, Germany, the world's biggest climate conference. The non-binding Paris accord, through which signatories pledge to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases over the coming decades, was brokered in 2015, when the annual conference was held in the French capital. The deal was considered historic because it was the first climate agreement to include the U.S. -- the world's biggest historic emitter, with by far the largest per-capita carbon footprint -- and China, which currently produces the most carbon pollution on a national level. The U.S. took a lead role in shaping the deal. Only war-torn Syria and Nicaragua, which protested the agreement's failure to impose strict demands on major polluters, refused to sign. But President Donald Trump, who rejects scientists' warnings about climate change, announced plans to withdraw from the pact in June, insisting developing nations received more benefits and the U.S. got none. In his announcement -- which, under the terms of the deal, fully can't go into effect until November 2020 -- Trump seemed to conflate the accord with a trade deal, demonstrating what was widely described as a poor understanding of how the Paris agreement actually works. \"Like the playground bully that eventually loses all his friends, Donald Trump has isolated himself on the world stage,\" Joe Ware,","Right":"Syria announced on Tuesday that it would be joining the Paris climate change agreement, leaving the United States as the only remaining country opposed to the deal after President Trump's June 1 decision to exit from the accord. \"There has been no change in the United States position on the Paris agreement,\" said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters in a statement to the Washington Examiner. \"As the president previously stated, the United States is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms more favorable for our country.\" The U.S. and Syria were the only remaining holdouts to the agreement after Nicaragua joined the Paris deal last month.

It was adopted by 196 parties at COP 21 in Paris on December 12, 2015, and entered into force on November 4, 2016.

Its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement has been seen as a major setback for the global effort to combat climate change. The US has argued that the agreement is unfair to American businesses and that it will harm the US economy. However, many experts have disputed these claims. They argue that the US can actually benefit from the agreement by investing in clean energy and by creating new jobs in the clean energy sector.\n\nThe US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement has also had a negative impact on the global effort to mobilize private finance for climate change. Many investors have been reluctant to invest in projects in countries that are not party to the agreement. This is because they are concerned about the risk of these projects being stranded if the countries withdraw from the agreement or if the agreement is not implemented effectively.\n\nThe US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement has made it more difficult to address climate change. However, there is still hope that the agreement can be successful. The remaining parties to the agreement are committed to implementing the agreement and to achieving its goals. They are also working to address the challenges posed by the US withdrawal."}

When a government tries to suppress the press, it is usually a sign that it is afraid of the truth.\n\nMcCain is right to be concerned about Trump's attacks on the media. Trump has repeatedly called the media \"the enemy of the people,\" and he has even suggested that the government should investigate the media for \"fake news.\" These attacks are dangerous, as they could lead to the government trying to silence the media or even shut it down altogether.\n\nA free press is essential to a free society. Without a free press, citizens would not be able to hold their government accountable. They would not be able to know what their government is doing, and they would not be able to make informed decisions about their leaders.\n\nIt is important for all Americans to stand up for the free press. We need to let our government know that we will not tolerate any attempts to silence the media. We need to support the media, and we need to hold them accountable for their reporting.\n\nA free press is one of the most important things we have. We must not let it be taken away from us."}

She outlined four key areas where she believes change is needed:\n\n1. **Defeating the ideology of extremism.** May said that the solution to terrorism is not simply to increase security measures, but to defeat the ideology of extremism itself. She called for a more proactive approach to countering extremist propaganda and ideology, and for working to build a more tolerant and inclusive society.\n2. **Tackling the root causes of extremism.** May acknowledged that there are a number of factors that can contribute to radicalization, including poverty, inequality, and lack of opportunity. She called for a more comprehensive approach to addressing these issues, including investing in education and social programs.\n3. **Strengthening international cooperation.** May said that the international community must work together to share intelligence, coordinate law enforcement efforts, and prevent the flow of funding to terrorist groups. She also called for greater cooperation on border security and travel restrictions.\n4. **Protecting our values.** May said that the UK must stand up for its values of freedom, democracy, and human rights, even in the face of terrorism. She called on the British people to remain united and resilient in the face of these challenges.\n\nMay's speech was well-received by many, who praised her for her clear and concise message. However, some critics have pointed out that her proposals are unlikely to be easy to implement, and that they may not be enough to prevent future terrorist attacks. Nevertheless, May's speech is an important step in the fight against terrorism, and it is clear that the international community must do more to work together to address this global threat.\n\nIn addition to May's four key areas, there are a number of other things that can be done to combat terrorism. These include:\n\n* **Investing in education and social programs.** As May noted, poverty, inequality, and lack of opportunity can all contribute to radicalization. By investing in education and social programs, we can help to create a more just and inclusive society, which will make it less likely that people will turn to violence.\n* **Promoting tolerance and understanding.** One of the most effective ways to combat extremism is to promote tolerance and understanding between different groups of people. This can be done through education, media campaigns, and community outreach programs.\n* **Tackling online radicalization.** The internet has become a major platform for extremist groups to spread their message. We need to work to counter this propaganda and to prevent young people from being radicalized online.\n* **Strengthening border security.** We need to do more to prevent terrorists from entering our countries. This includes improving intelligence sharing, strengthening border controls, and cracking down on human smuggling.\n* **Enhancing cooperation with other countries.** Terrorism is a global problem, and it can only be solved through international cooperation. We need to work with other countries to share intelligence, coordinate law enforcement efforts, and prevent the flow of funding to terrorist groups.\n\nTackling terrorism is a complex and difficult challenge, but it is one that we must face.

On Tuesday, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Kenosha Unified School District in Wisconsin violated the rights of a trans student, Ash Whitaker, when it refused to let him use the boys' bathroom. According to the court, Whitaker is likely to win upon a full review of the case (instead of the current review of a lower court's preliminary injunction) on his claim that the school's actions violated Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination in schools based on sex, and the Equal Protections Clause of the 14th Amendment.

As Jacobs and a Fox News crew told it, it was a shocking assault on a reporter just one day before a special election to fill the state's lone House seat. But it was hardly an isolated occurrence. In the past three weeks, political reporters have described being arrested, pinned against a wall, slapped, and now body slammed -- all this in a nation where freedom of the press is enshrined in the Constitution. Alaska Dispatch News reporter Nathaniel Herz told police earlier this month that Republican state Sen. David Wilson slapped him during an encounter over a recent story.

And last week, CQ Roll Call reporter John M. Donnelly said he was pinned against a wall by security guards after trying to ask a Federal Communications Commission member a question in Washington. The Gianforte incident stood out, in part, because of the galling absence of an apology from the candidate.

As Jacobs and a Fox News crew told it, it was a shocking assault on a reporter just one day before a special election to fill the state's lone House seat. But it was hardly an isolated occurrence. In the past three weeks, political reporters have described being arrested, pinned against a wall, slapped, and now body slammed -- all this in a nation where freedom of the press is enshrined in the Constitution. Alaska Dispatch News reporter Nathaniel Herz told police earlier this month that Republican state Sen. David Wilson slapped him during an encounter over a recent story. West Virginia reporter Dan Heyman was arrested on May 10 while trying to ask a question of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who later praised police for their handling of the situation. And last week, CQ Roll Call reporter John M. Donnelly said he was pinned against a wall by security guards after trying to ask a Federal Communications Commission member a question in Washington. The Gianforte incident stood out, in part, because of the galling absence of an apology from the candidate.

The special counsel's investigation is one way to ensure that justice is served, regardless of who is involved."}

The White House sought nearly $1.4 billion in taxpayer dollars for the wall and related costs in the spending bill, but Trump later relented and said the issue could wait until September.\n\nWith language about the border wall omitted, Democratic leaders praised the effort.\n\n'The bill ensures taxpayer dollars aren't used to fund an ineffective border wall, excludes poison pill riders, and increases investments in programs that the middle class relies on, like medical research, education and infrastructure,' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., echoed Schumer's praise, saying in a separate statement 'the omnibus does not fund President Trump's reckless border wall, and instead provides critical investments in our communities.'\n\nThe bill also includes a number of other provisions, including funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides health insurance to millions of low-income children, and a measure to prevent a government shutdown on March 15.\n\nThe spending package is expected to pass both chambers of Congress with bipartisan support."}

When people believe that they can't trust the media, they are more likely to believe false information and conspiracy theories. This can have serious consequences, such as the spread of violence and hatred.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why Trump might attack the media. One possibility is that he is simply trying to protect his own ego. When the media reports negative things about him, it can be difficult for him to accept that he is not perfect. This can lead to feelings of anger and resentment, which he may express by lashing out at the media.\n\nAnother possibility is that Trump is trying to control the narrative. He knows that the media has a lot of power to shape public opinion, and he wants to make sure that the media is only reporting things that make him look good. By attacking the media, he can try to discredit them and make it seem like they are not reliable sources of information.\n\nWhatever the reason, Trump's attacks on the media are a dangerous trend. They undermine trust in institutions that are essential to a functioning democracy, and they make it more difficult for people to get accurate information about the world around them."}

The march was the culmination of months of pressure from activists and journalists who have been trying to get Trump to release his tax returns since he announced his candidacy for president in June 2015. Trump is the first major party presidential nominee in decades to refuse to release his tax returns.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why people want to see Trump's tax returns. First, it is customary for presidential candidates to release their tax returns so that voters can see how they have made their money and whether they have any conflicts of interest. Second, Trump has made a number of claims about his wealth and his business dealings that have not been independently verified. Releasing his tax returns would provide evidence to support or refute these claims. Third, Trump has been accused of tax evasion and other financial crimes. Releasing his tax returns would allow investigators to examine these allegations.\n\nTrump has refused to release his tax returns for a number of reasons. He has said that he is under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and that releasing his returns would jeopardize the audit. However, there is no legal precedent for this claim. The IRS has said that it would not interfere with an audit if Trump were to release his tax returns.\n\nTrump has also said that he does not want to release his tax returns because they are \"very complex\" and that people would not understand them. However, this claim is also not credible. Trump's tax returns would be subject to the same Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests as any other government document. If Trump were to release his tax returns, the public would be able to review them and make their own judgments about his finances.\n\nThe Tax March was a successful event in that it drew a large crowd and generated a lot of media attention. However, it is unclear whether it will succeed in getting Trump to release his tax returns. Trump has so far shown no willingness to comply with the public's demand for transparency."}

{"Key":"news347","Left":"Video TANTA, Egypt -- Rattling a country already wrestling with a faltering economy and deepening political malaise, two suicide bombings that killed 44 people at Coptic churches in Egypt on Palm Sunday raised the specter of increased sectarian bloodshed led by Islamic State militants. The attacks constituted one of the deadliest days of violence against Christians in Egypt in decades and presented a challenge to the authority of the country's leader, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who promptly declared a three-month state of emergency. Security is the central promise of Mr. Sisi, a strongman leader who returned on Friday from a triumphant visit to the United States, where President Trump hailed him as a bulwark against Islamist violence.

It is a sign of the deep divisions that exist in the country and the willingness of both parties to use extreme measures to achieve their goals.\n\nThe nuclear option is a term used to describe the process of changing the rules of the Senate in order to reduce the number of votes required to end a filibuster. In the past, a filibuster required 60 votes to end, which meant that the minority party could block a nomination or legislation even if the majority party had a majority of seats in the Senate. However, in 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) invoked the nuclear option to reduce the number of votes required to end a filibuster for lower court nominations from 60 to 51. This change was made in response to Republican obstruction of President Barack Obama's judicial nominees.\n\nThe use of the nuclear option by Republicans to confirm Gorsuch is a direct response to Reid's decision in 2013. Republicans argue that they are simply following the precedent set by Democrats. However, Democrats argue that the nuclear option is a dangerous precedent that will further erode the Senate's ability to function as a deliberative body.\n\nThe use of the nuclear option by Republicans to confirm Gorsuch is likely to have a significant impact on the future of the Supreme Court. It will make it much easier for future presidents to appoint justices who share their views, regardless of the views of the minority party. This could lead to a more ideologically divided Court, which would make it more difficult for the Court to reach consensus on important issues.\n\nThe use of the nuclear option is also likely to have a negative impact on the Senate as a whole. It will make it more difficult for the Senate to pass legislation, as the minority party will be able to block any bill that does not have the support of 60 senators. This could lead to a more gridlocked government, which would make it more difficult to address the country's problems.\n\nThe use of the nuclear option by Republicans to confirm Gorsuch is a major step towards a more partisan and dysfunctional government. It is a sign that both parties are willing to use extreme measures to achieve their goals, even if it means damaging the institutions of government."}

A second explosive device was left at a different metro station but did not detonate. Police initially said the device had been left on the train by the attacker, and that a search was under way for two people suspected of organising and carrying out the attack.

The explosion occurred at around 2.30pm local time on Monday, after the train had left Sennaya Ploshchad station in the centre of St Petersburg. The driver made the decision to continue to the next station, Tekhnologicheskii Institut, in order to make evacuation easier.

A second explosive device was left at a different metro station but did not detonate. Police initially said the device had been left on the train by the attacker, and that a search was under way for two people suspected of organising and carrying out the attack. Later, however, the Interfax news agency claimed the blast had in fact been caused by a suicide bomber, citing a law enforcement source, but there was no immediate confirmation of this. The explosion occurred at around 2.30pm local time on Monday, after the train had left Sennaya Ploshchad station in the centre of St Petersburg. The driver made the decision to continue to the next station, Tekhnologicheskii Institut, in order to make evacuation easier. Those on the train spoke of a blast that was mainly felt in the carriage where it occurred, three from the front of the train. 'I don't think it was that loud, but then I was wearing headphones,' said Andrei Shurshev, who was in the next carriage along.

He has ordered security forces to step up their efforts to combat terrorism, and has vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nThe attack is the latest in a series of terrorist attacks in Russia in recent years. In 2017, a suicide bomber killed at least 16 people at a metro station in Moscow. And in 2018, a bomb attack on a concert hall in the city of Kerch killed at least 21 people.\n\nThe attacks have raised concerns about the threat of terrorism in Russia. The country has been battling an Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus region for decades, and the attacks have shown that the threat of terrorism extends to major cities like Moscow and St Petersburg.\n\nThe Russian government has responded to the attacks by increasing security measures and cracking down on suspected terrorists. But the attacks have also led to a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment in Russia.\n\nThe attack on the St Petersburg metro is a reminder of the threat of terrorism in Russia.

The law prohibited transgender people from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity in government buildings and public schools. It also blocked local governments from passing their own anti-discrimination ordinances. HB2 was widely seen as discriminatory against transgender people, and it led to boycotts of North Carolina businesses and sporting events.\n\nIn March 2017, North Carolina Republican lawmakers and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper agreed on a compromise to repeal HB2. The compromise law, called House Bill 142, repealed HB2 but also reinstated some of its provisions. For example, HB142 required transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponds with their sex assigned at birth in government buildings and public schools. It also prevented local governments from passing their own anti-discrimination ordinances for six months.\n\nThe compromise law was met with mixed reactions. Some people praised it for repealing HB2, while others criticized it for not going far enough to protect transgender people. The law was also challenged in court, and in August 2018, a federal judge struck down HB142.\n\nThe HB2 controversy was a major setback for LGBTQ rights in the United States. It showed that even in states with relatively progressive laws on the books, transgender people are still vulnerable to discrimination. The controversy also highlighted the need for federal legislation to protect LGBTQ people from discrimination."}

Doing so would throw a wrench in Team Trump's narrative, that under his predecessor, the country was a post-apocalyptic wasteland where the unemployment rate was 42 percent. Unfortunately, not everyone in the administration got the memo that presumably read \"ANYTHING POSITIVE THAT HAPPENS MUST BE ATTRIBUTED TO TRUMP, NO EXCEPTIONS!\" And that someone was National Economic Council director Gary Cohn.

A grinning White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he specifically asked the president Friday morning if he believed the new jobs report. \"They may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now,\" Mr. Trump told his spokesman. After the New Hampshire Republican primary last year, Mr. Trump said, \"Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.\" Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the strong hiring numbers in February were due to the policies of the previous administration. \"Thanks, Obama!\" he said.

Great news for American workers!' What Team Trump didn't mention, though, was that in February 2016, the U.S. added 237,000 jobs and in February 2015, it added 238,000, accomplishments for which Trump was loathe to give Barack Obama credit. Doing so would throw a wrench in Team Trump's narrative, that under his predecessor, the country was a post-apocalyptic wasteland where the unemployment rate was 42 percent. Unfortunately, not everyone in the administration got the memo that presumably read 'ANYTHING POSITIVE THAT HAPPENS MUST BE ATTRIBUTED TO TRUMP, NO EXCEPTIONS!' And that someone was National Economic Council director Gary Cohn. Per Business Insider: During an interview with CNBC, Cohn said the report was 'right exactly where it needed to be,' but he also said that Trump's team wasn't the reason for the beat. For one thing, Cohn said, the jobs that were promised by C.E.O.s who have met with Trump haven't been created yet. 'Look, there's clearly a good February as part of the number. I'm not going to deny that,' Cohn said. 'But on the other hand, when you look at what we've been doing here at the White House and all of the C.E.O.s that we've brought in--whether it be Exxon or Sprint President Trump, who as a candidate often criticized the government's jobs' reports during the Obama administration as 'phony,' became a believer on Friday. The Labor Department, now part of the Trump administration, reported Friday that employers added 235,000 jobs in Mr. Trump's first full month in office, and the unemployment rate dropped slightly to 4.7 percent. A grinning White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he specifically asked the president Friday morning if he believed the new jobs report. 'They may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now,' Mr. Trump told his spokesman. After the New Hampshire Republican primary last year, Mr. Trump said, 'Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.' Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the strong hiring numbers in February were due to the policies of the previous administration. 'Thanks, Obama!' he said. Mr. Spicer said Mr. Trump's actions clearly are having an impact with employers. Asked at the daily press briefing whether Mr. Trump tweeted prematurely about the positive jobs report, Mr. Spicer retorted to a journalist, 'Don't make me make the podium move.' It was a reference to 'Saturday Night Live,' where Melissa McCarthy portrays Mr. Spicer in command of a mobile podium that he plows into the assembled reporters when annoyed.

This was the first full month of President Trump's administration, and he quickly took credit for the positive numbers. However, some experts have pointed out that the jobs report was not entirely due to Trump's policies. For example, the unemployment rate had been steadily declining for months before Trump took office. Additionally, some of the jobs that were added in February were in low-wage sectors, such as retail and food service. While the February jobs report was positive overall, it is too early to say whether Trump's policies are having a significant impact on the economy.\n\nIt is important to note that the February jobs report was not without its critics. Some economists have argued that the report was inflated due to the fact that many people were forced to take part-time jobs because they could not find full-time work. Additionally, some have pointed out that the unemployment rate is still high, particularly for African Americans and Hispanics.\n\nOverall, the February jobs report was a positive sign for the economy. However, it is too early to say whether Trump's policies are having a significant impact on job growth. It will be important to keep an eye on future jobs reports to see if the positive trend continues."}

Trump has made the accusation several times, but he has never provided any evidence to support it. In fact, the evidence that we do have suggests that Trump's claim is false.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand how wiretapping works. The government can only wiretap someone if it has a warrant from a FISA court. A FISA warrant is a very high bar to clear, and it requires the government to show that there is probable cause to believe that the person being wiretapped is an agent of a foreign power.\n\nIn order to get a FISA warrant, the government must submit an application to the court. This application must include detailed information about the person being wiretapped, as well as the reasons why the government believes that person is an agent of a foreign power. The application must also be approved by a judge, who is supposed to independently review the evidence and make a decision based on the law.\n\nSo, what evidence does the government have to support Trump's claim that he was wiretapped? Well, the answer is: none. The government has never released any evidence to support Trump's claim, and there is no evidence that has been leaked to the press that supports it either.\n\nIn fact, the evidence that we do have suggests that Trump's claim is false. For example, we know that the FBI was investigating Trump's campaign for possible ties to Russia. However, we also know that the FBI did not have any evidence to support the claim that Trump was an agent of a foreign power. In fact, the FBI's investigation was based on the Steele dossier, which was a collection of unverified and largely discredited allegations.\n\nSo, what is the explanation for Trump's claim? Well, it's possible that he is simply lying. It's also possible that he is misremembering or misunderstanding something. Or, it's possible that he is being misled by someone who is trying to damage him.\n\nWhatever the explanation, it's clear that Trump's claim that he was wiretapped by Obama is false. There is no evidence to support it, and the evidence that we do have suggests that it is false."}
