    your goal is to describe all the common information between the given documents. to accomplish this you will need to answer the following:
    - who or what are the common subjects of the two documents
    - what events are common between the documents
    - do the documents mention any locations that are the same between the two
    - keep your response brief. 2 sentences max.

    your response will be evaluated according to how similar it is to a "reference summary".
    For example, an output of "cat" could be compared to "light" to get a score of 0 but that same output could be compared to "cat" to receive a score of 100. These reference summaries are brief so going over 2 sentences could lead to poor scores.
