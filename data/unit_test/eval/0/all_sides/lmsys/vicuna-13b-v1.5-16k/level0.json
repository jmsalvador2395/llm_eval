The subpoena was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which also said that the subpoena does not compel testimony by any of the officials. The source said the campaign has already turned over some 20,000 documents voluntarily, so it's not clear why the subpoena was issued. A subpoena ratchets up the stakes for noncompliance.

Mueller, a former FBI director, and his investigators are probing any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. Congressional committees that are also investigating possible collusion had asked the the campaign to turn over Russia-related material dating back to the beginning of Trump's campaign in summer 2015. On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee said that Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, had failed to turn over all the documents it had requested.","Right":"According to the Wall Street Journal, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian collusion and election tampering included issuing subpoenas for over a dozen Trump campaign officials. According to the report, the subpoenas were issued in mid-October and the campaign officials have been providing documents to the investigation having to do with the Russian government. A lawyer for the president said there was \"total cooperation\" with the investigation. What do we know so far about Mueller's investigation? Leaks from Mueller's investigation have indicated that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was being targeted in the probe - he has since been charged with conspiracy against the United States and money laundering. Former campaign official George Papadopoulos was also reported to have pleaded guilty to lying to federal officials about his interactions with the Russians. Mueller appeared to be at the center of the controversy over President Trump's anger at Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigations. Trump blames Sessions for the creation of the special counsel, though even his allies have pointed out that it was Trump's own actions that precipitated the naming of Mueller.","Ahmed_Intersection":"Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian collusion.

The subpoena was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which also said that the subpoena does not compel testimony by any of the officials. The source said the campaign has already turned over some 20,000 documents voluntarily, so it's not clear why the subpoena was issued. A subpoena ratchets up the stakes for noncompliance. Play Facebook Twitter Embed Mueller issues grand jury subpoenas for Trump campaign documents 3:28 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog The Journal reported that the Trump campaign had been caught by surprise by the subpoena. Mueller, a former FBI director, and his investigators are probing any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. Congressional committees that are also investigating possible collusion had asked the the campaign to turn over Russia-related material dating back to the beginning of Trump's campaign in summer 2015. On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee said that Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, had failed to turn over all the documents it had requested. According to the Wall Street Journal, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian collusion and election tampering included issuing subpoenas for over a dozen Trump campaign officials. According to the report, the subpoenas were issued in mid-October and the campaign officials have been providing documents to the investigation having to do with the Russian government. A lawyer for the president said there was 'total cooperation' with the investigation. What do we know so far about Mueller's investigation? Leaks from Mueller's investigation have indicated that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was being targeted in the probe - he has since been charged with conspiracy against the United States and money laundering. Former campaign official George Papadopoulos was also reported to have pleaded guilty to lying to federal officials about his interactions with the Russians. Mueller appeared to be at the center of the controversy over President Trump's anger at Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigations. Trump blames Sessions for the creation of the special counsel, though even his allies have pointed out that it was Trump's own actions that precipitated the naming of Mueller.","system_text":null,"response":"\u7f8e\u570b\u7279\u6b8a\u6aa2\u5bdf\u5b98\u7a46\u52d2\u7684\u5718\u968a\u767c\u51fa\u4e86\u91dd\u5c0d\u5ddd\u666e\u7af6\u9078\u6d3b\u52d5\u7684\u6307\u63a7\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u591a\u540d\u7af6\u9078\u5b98\u54e1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8207\u4fc4\u7f85\u65af\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f86\u6e90\u7a31\u5176\u5df2\u7d93\u81ea\u9858\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d85\u904e20,000\u4efd\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u7a46\u52d2\u7684\u8abf\u67e5\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5ddd\u666e\u7af6\u9078\u6d3b\u52d5\u8207\u4fc4\u7f85\u65af\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u52fe\u7d50\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u6d89\u53ca\u8a72\u570b\u653f\u5e9c\u3002\u806f\u90a6\u53c3\u8b70\u9662\u6cd5\u5f8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u8981\u6c42\u7af6\u9078\u6d3b\u52d5\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea2015\u5e74\u590f\u5b63\u958b\u59cb\u7684\u4fc4\u7f85\u65af\u76f8\u95dc\u8cc7\u6599\u3002\u53c3\u8b70\u9662\u6cd5\u5f8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5ddd\u666e\u7684\u5a7f\u5b50\u9752\u7530\u00b7\u5eab\u514b\u6c92\u6709\u4ea4\u51fa\u6240\u6709\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u3002"}

The university plans to start providing loan-free aid to its students as early as the 2018-2019 academic year if it meets its fundraising goal. 'We're committed to making a Brown education accessible to students from all income groups, so we can continue to accept the very best and brightest students from around the world,' Brown University President Christina Paxson said in a statement. 'When students and their families are sitting at their dining room tables making decisions about where to apply to college, or whether to accept an offer of admission, we want them to know that Brown is an affordable choice,' Paxson added. The university is looking to raise $120 million to cover this initiative, which is part of a $3 billion fundraising campaign the school launched in 2015. Brown will have to raise an additional $4.5 million per year for its financial aid budget to cover its undergraduate population of roughly 6,500 students. The Ivy League school also made headlines this week when it announced that administrators accepted a $300,000 grant from the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) to offer segregated dinners for Muslim and black students. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation and Newman's Own Foundation, both foundations with a history of donating to left-wing organizations and causes, funded the grant. The university also accepted a $5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health in January to study whether fraternity boys drink more than their peers who do not partake in Greek Life.","system_text":null,"response":"\u5e03\u6717\u5927\u5b66\u65e8\u5728\u65bc\u5b78\u751f\u8cc7\u52a9\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u53d6\u6d88\u8cb8\u6b3e\uff0c\u4e26\u66ff\u63db\u6210\u4e0d\u5fc5\u9084\u6b3e\u7684\u52a9\u5b78\u91d1\uff0c\u8a72\u5b78\u6821\u5728\u9031\u4e09\u767c\u5e03\u8072\u660e\u5ba3\u5e03\u3002\u201c\u6211\u5011\u81f4\u529b\u65bc\u70ba\u4f86\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u6536\u5165\u7fa4\u9ad4\u7684\u5b78\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e03\u6717\u5927\u5b78\u7684\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u6211\u5011\u7e7c\u7e8c\u62db\u6536\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u6700\u512a\u79c0\u6700\u8070\u660e\u7684\u5b78\u751f\uff0c\u201d\u5e03\u6717\u5927\u5b78\u6821\u9577Christina Paxson\u8aaa\u3002 \u201c\u7576\u5b78\u751f\u53ca\u5176\u5bb6\u5ead\u5750\u5728\u5ba2\u5ef3\u88e1\u8a0e\u8ad6\u662f\u5426\u8981\u7533\u8acb\u5927\u5b78\u6216\u63a5\u53d7\u9304\u53d6\u7684\u63d0\u8b70\u6642\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671b\u4ed6\u5011\u77e5\u9053\u5e03\u6717\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u53ef\u8ca0\u64d4\u7684\u9078\u64c7\u3002\u201d \u8a72\u653f\u7b56\u65e8\u5728\u5e6b\u52a9\u201c\u4f86\u81ea\u4e2d\u7b49\u6536\u5165\u5bb6\u5ead\u201d\u7684\u5b78\u751f\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u5b78\u751f\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u8ca1\u52d9\u63f4\u52a9\u5957\u9910\uff0c\u4f46\u7121\u6cd5\u81ea\u5df1\u627f\u64d4\u5927\u5b78\u7684\u5168\u90e8\u8cbb\u7528\u3002 \u5e03\u6717\u5927\u5b78\u5e0c\u671b\u52302018\u5e74\u5e95\u7c4c\u96c63000\u842c\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5f9e2018-2019\u5b78\u5e74\u958b\u59cb\u6d88\u9664\u8cb8\u6b3e\u3002 \u5e03\u6717\u5927\u5b78\u8a08\u5283\u57282018-2019\u5b78\u5e74\u65e9\u671f\u958b\u59cb\u5411\u5176\u73fe\u6709\u548c\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u672c\u79d1\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u8cb8\u6b3e\u7684\u8cc7\u52a9\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u9054\u5230\u7c4c\u6b3e\u76ee\u6a19\u3002 \u8a72\u5b78\u6821\u6b63\u5728\u7c4c\u96c6\u8cc7\u91d1\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9019\u9805\u8a08\u5283\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u8a72\u5b78\u6821\u65bc2015\u5e74\u555f\u52d5\u768430\u5104\u7f8e\u5143\u7c4c\u6b3e\u6d3b\u52d5\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002 \u5e03\u6717\u5927\u5b78\u9084\u5fc5\u9808\u6bcf\u5e74\u7c4c\u96c6450\u842c\u7f8e\u5143\u4ee5\u6db5\u84cb\u5176\u8ca1\u52d9\u63f4\u52a9\u9810\u7b97\uff0c\u4ee5\u8986\u84cb\u7d046500\u540d\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u672c\u79d1\u751f\u4eba\u6578\u3002 \u672c\u5468\uff0c\u5e03\u6717\u5927\u5b78\u4e5f\u5728\u5a92\u9ad4\u4e0a\u50b3\u51fa\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u8a72\u5b78\u6821\u63a5\u53d7\u4e8630\u842c\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u6350\u6b3e\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u70ba\u7a46\u65af\u6797\u548c\u9ed1\u4eba\u5b78\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5206\u96e2\u7684\u665a\u9910\u3002 \u9019\u7b46\u6350\u6b3e\u662f\u7531\u6e25\u514b\u00b7\u51f1\u6d1b\u683c\u57fa\u91d1\u6703\u548cNewman's Own Foundation\u6350\u6b3e\uff0c\u9019\u5169\u500b\u57fa\u91d1\u6703\u90fd\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u6350\u6b3e\u6b77\u53f2\uff0c\u8d0a\u52a9\u5de6\u7ffc\u7d44\u7e54\u548c\u4e8b\u696d\u3002 \u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8a72\u5927\u5b78\u9084\u65bc\u672c\u6708\u63a5\u53d7\u4e86500\u842c\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u6350\u6b3e\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u7814\u7a76\u5144\u5f1f\u6703\u7537\u751f\u662f\u5426\u98f2\u9152\u6bd4\u4e0d\u53c3\u8207\u5e0c\u81d8\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u540c\u5115\u98f2\u9152\u66f4\u591a\u3002"}

President Donald Trump has vehemently denied the White House colluded with Russia in any way.","system_text":null,"response":"2016 US elections were the subject of Russian hacking attempts."}

Markey announced his intention to file a resolution of disapproval in December, just after the FCC voted on new rules that killed net neutrality protections from 2015.

John Kennedy, R-La., and found himself fumbling over information that Kennedy implied should have been common knowledge. After admitting that he had no experience trying a jury trial, civil trial, criminal trial, bench trial or state or federal court trial, Petersen revealed a stunning display of ignorance over fundamental legal facts. Kennedy first asked about the Daubert Standard, which is used as a preliminary guideline for assessing the validity and applicability of a scientific expert's testimony. Petersen did not know the answer. Kennedy then asked about motion in limine, which is a motion made at the beginning of a trial to exclude certain evidence. After initially giving the appearance that he knew the answer to that question, Petersen had to admit when pressed that he did not.","Right":"One of President Trump's judicial nominees struggled to answer a Republican senator's questions at his confirmation hearing Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Kennedy was aware of Petersen's resume, but was clearly disappointed that the nominee did not have a basic understanding of terms he would undoubtedly see frequently in federal court. The Republican senator has criticized other Trump judicial picks in recent weeks. Upon learning that one of his nominees, Brett Talley, did not disclose that his wife was a White House lawyer, Kennedy spoke out. Trump is getting some \"very bad advice\" on these nominees, Kennedy said at the time.

John Kennedy, R-La., and found himself fumbling over information that Kennedy implied should have been common knowledge. After admitting that he had no experience trying a jury trial, civil trial, criminal trial, bench trial or state or federal court trial, Petersen revealed a stunning display of ignorance over fundamental legal facts. Kennedy first asked about the Daubert Standard, which is used as a preliminary guideline for assessing the validity and applicability of a scientific expert's testimony. Petersen did not know the answer. Kennedy then asked about motion in limine, which is a motion made at the beginning of a trial to exclude certain evidence. After initially giving the appearance that he knew the answer to that question, Petersen had to admit when pressed that he did not. One of President Trump's judicial nominees struggled to answer a Republican senator's questions at his confirmation hearing Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) pressed Matthew Spencer Petersen, nominee for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, to define several legal terms. He did not seem able to offer a direct answer to any of the inquiries. 'I would probably not be able to give you a good definition,' Petersen responded when asked to define 'a motion in limine.' 'I don't have that readily at my disposal' and 'I haven't been able to do a deep dive' were a couple of his other go to answers. He simply shook his head on other occasions. 'When is the last time you read the Federal Rules of Evidence,' Kennedy wondered at one point. 'Comprehensively - in law school,' Kennedy noted. 'Hoo-boy,' Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) said, sharing the cringe worthy five-minute exchange on Twitter.

Hoo-boy. pic.twitter.com\/fphQx2o1rc -- Sheldon Whitehouse (@SenWhitehouse) December 15, 2017 Petersen admitted there would be 'challenges' to ease into his role as a district court judge, but he has experience in a decision making role as a commissioner on the Federal Election Commission. Kennedy was aware of Petersen's resume, but was clearly disappointed that the nominee did not have a basic understanding of terms he would undoubtedly see frequently in federal court. The Republican senator has criticized other Trump judicial picks in recent weeks. Upon learning that one of his nominees, Brett Talley, did not disclose that his wife was a White House lawyer, Kennedy spoke out. Trump is getting some 'very bad advice' on these nominees, Kennedy said at the time. The White House has since withdrawn Talley's nomination, as well as the nomination of Jeff Mateer, who had a history of controversial comments.","system_text":null,"response":"1.

The bill lowers the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, and Republicans, including President Trump, argued doing so would help to boost wages and create jobs. After the tax plan was sent to Trump's desk, companies such as AT&T, Wells Fargo, and Fifth Third Bancorp announced additional benefits for their employees, including $1,000 one-time bonuses and an increase in their minimum wages to $15 an hour. Despite Rubio's skepticism about whether the tax plan would lead to economic growth, he said the bill is a vast improvement from the current system. \"There's a lot of things in the bill that I have supported for a long time, [such as] doubling the child tax credit, and it is better -- significantly better -- than the current code,\" he said.

'I thought we probably went too far on (helping) corporations. By and large, you're going to see a lot of these multinationals buy back shares to drive up the price. Some of them will be forced, because they're sitting on historic levels of cash, to pay out dividends to shareholders. That isn't going to create dramatic economic growth.' Rubio then went on to defend the bill by pointing out that it doubles the Child Tax Credit and claiming that 'it is better - significantly better - than the current code.' After explaining how he persuaded many of his fellow Republicans about the merits of the Child Tax Credit by proving that it wasn't welfare, Rubio then addressed the potential political ramifications of the bill. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., believes the recently passed Republican tax plan 'probably went too far' with helping big companies. 'If I were king for a day, this tax bill would have looked different,' Rubio told southwest Florida's News-Press in an interview published Friday. 'I thought we probably went too far on [helping] corporations. By and large, you're going to see a lot of these multinationals buy back shares to drive up the price. Some of them will be forced, because they're sitting on historic levels of cash, to pay out dividends to shareholders. That isn't going to create dramatic economic growth.' Rubio supported the tax bill, which passed the House and Senate last week and was signed by President Trump just before Christmas. The bill lowers the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, and Republicans, including President Trump, argued doing so would help to boost wages and create jobs. After the tax plan was sent to Trump's desk, companies such as AT&T, Wells Fargo, and Fifth Third Bancorp announced additional benefits for their employees, including $1,000 one-time bonuses and an increase in their minimum wages to $15 an hour. Despite Rubio's skepticism about whether the tax plan would lead to economic growth, he said the bill is a vast improvement from the current system. 'There's a lot of things in the bill that I have supported for a long time, [such as] doubling the child tax credit, and it is better -- significantly better -- than the current code,' he said. Polls have indicated few Americans support the Republican tax bill, but Rubio said he believes their opinions will change once the taxpayers realize they're taking home more money. 'Opinion today is based on what they've read and what they've been told it does.

Susan Collins, R-Maine, is also withholding her support because it would slow the rate of growth in spending on Medicaid. 'This bill would make sweeping cuts to the Medicaid program, which has been a staple for 50 years,' Collins said Sunday on ABC's 'This Week with George Stephanopoulos.' McCain and eight others have expressed doubts about the bill and if they vote 'no,' it will fail. With the vote now tabled, there's even more pressure on lawmakers to deliver on something many of them have promised for years: repealing and replacing Obamacare, which they warn is collapsing. Some say if this bill doesn't pass, they'll have to come up with a different plan.","system_text":null,"response":"\u7f8e\u56fd\u53c2\u8bae\u5458\u7ea6\u7ff0\u00b7\u9ea6\u51ef\u6069\uff08John McCain\uff09\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8840\u6813\u624b\u672f\u800c\u79bb\u5f00\u4e86\u9ea6\u5eb7\u5948\u5c14\uff08Mitch McConnell\uff09\u7684\u628a\u63e1\u3002\u53c2\u8bae\u5458\u7ea6\u7ff0\u00b7\u9ea6\u51ef\u6069\uff08John McCain\uff09\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u4e9a\u5229\u6851\u90a3\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\uff0c\u624b\u672f\u662f\u5728\u4ed6\u5de6\u773c\u4e0a\u65b9\u5220\u96645\u5398\u7c73\u8840\u6813\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u534e\u76db\u987f\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u751f\u6d3b\u4e0d\u4f1a\u50cf\u5e73\u5e38\u90a3\u6837\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u591a\u6570\u9886\u8896\u9ea6\u5eb7\u5948\u5c14\uff08Mitch McConnell\uff09\u56e0\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5171\u548c\u515a\u53c2\u8bae\u5458\u7684\u6295\u7968\u4ee5\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u300a\u7279\u6717\u666e\u5065\u5eb7\u4fdd\u5065\u6cd5\u300b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a8\u8fdf\u4e86\u6295\u7968\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u9ea6\u51ef\u6069\uff08John McCain\uff09\u7684\u6062\u590d\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4e24\u5468\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9b\u53cd\u5bf9\u6d3e\u6297\u4e89\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u63012.2\u4ebf\u4eba\u4fdd\u6301\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\u6765\u770b\u3002\u58f0\u97f3\u5f3a\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6d3e\u53cd\u5bf9\u8005\uff0c\u53c2\u8bae\u5458\u4e39\u5c3c\u5c14\u00b7\u5e15\u5c14\uff08Rand Paul\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\u7684\u7acb\u573a\uff0c\u8ba9\u4ed6\u4eec\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53cd\u5bf9\u8fd9\u9879\u6cd5\u6848\u3002\u5728CBS\u7684\u300a\u9762\u5bf9\u56fd\u5bb6\u300b\uff08Face the Nation\uff09\u91c7\u8bbf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e15\u5c14\uff08R-Ky.\uff09\u5468\u65e5\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u201c\u6bcf\u6b21\u6cd5\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u5f97\u8d8a\u4e45\uff0c\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u5171\u548c\u515a\u4eba\u4f1a\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4e0d\u662f\u53d6\u6d88\uff08repeal\uff09\u3002\u201d\u5e15\u5c14\uff08R-Ky.\uff09\u4e5f\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u666e\u9009\u7968\u8f93\u7ed9\u8005\u591a\u7c73\u5c3c\u514b\u00b7\u7279\u6717\u666e\uff08Donald Trump\uff09\uff0c\u4ed6\u8868\u793a\u7279\u6717\u666e\u5168\u529b\u8d5e\u6210\u7acb\u5373\u53d6\u6d88\u4e00\u5207\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u518d\u8865\u5145\u3002\u7279\u6717\u666e\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u8bf4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bdd\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u201c\u6124\u6012\u7684\u65e9\u6668\u63a8\u6587\u4e2d\u8c08\u8bba\u4e86\u5e0c\u62c9\u91cc\u00b7\u514b\u6797\u987f\uff08Hillary Clinton\uff09\u3001\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u4e89\u8bae\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u8bdd\u9898\u3002\u201d\u770b\u6765\uff0c\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u9669\u653f\u7b56\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u7279\u6717\u666e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u5934\u8111\u98ce\u66b4\u3002\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u8c13\u7684\u5171\u548c\u515a\u4e2d\u95f4\u6d3e\u5c06\u53d7\u5230\u6765\u81ea\u5176\u9009\u6c11\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6740\u6b7b\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6765\u81ea\u9ea6\u5eb7\u5948\u5c14\uff08Mitch McConnell\uff09\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4fdd\u5b88\u6d3e\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6d3e\u5e15\u5c14\uff08Rand Paul\uff09\u548c\u5a01\u5c14\u900a\u00b7\u5361\u6d1b\u5c14\uff08Susan Collins\uff0cR-ME\uff09\u5df2\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u53cd\u5bf9\uff0c\u53cd\u5bf9\u6d3e\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6000\u7591\uff0c\u5c31\u8db3\u4ee5\u62d2\u7edd\u8be5\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u9ea6\u5eb7\u5948\u5c14\uff08Mitch McConnell\uff09\u7684\u4fdd\u5bc6\u3001\u79c1\u4eba\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}

Astounded and offended by Weinstein's attempt to coerce her into bed, Judd managed to escape. But instead of keeping quiet about the kind of encounter that could easily shame a woman into silence, she began spreading the word. [...] Juana Melara, who has worked as a hotel housekeeper for decades, says she and her fellow housekeepers didn't complain about guests who exposed themselves or masturbated in front of them for fear of losing the paycheck they needed to support their families. Melara recalls 'feeling the pressure of someone's eyes' on her as she cleaned a guest's room. When she turned around, she remembers, a man was standing in the doorway, blocked by the cleaning cart, with his erect penis exposed. She yelled at the top of her lungs and scared him into leaving, then locked the door behind him. 'Nothing happened to me that time, thank God,' she recalls. As for Donald Trump, who cares so much about being chosen that he was tweeting defensively about having turned it down weeks ago, he was runner up. So President Trump was this year's runner up in the TIME Magazine Person of the Year search. He claimed in a tweet last week that the editors called him wanting to give him the honor, but he said no thanks after they demanded a photoshoot and interview. TIME offered the big reveal to the TODAY show Wednesday, telling the anchors that Trump's tweet was incorrect. Still, the president earned the second place position because he changed politics and is on the verge of his first major legislative achievement. The main recognition, however, went to The Silence Breakers - the female forces behind the #MeToo movement. Tarana Burke, Megyn Kelly, and actresses Ashley Judd, Alyssa Milano and Rose McGowan were just some of the women TIME interviewed for the top title. All had a hand in empowering women to speak out about sexual abuse in their respective industries, the editors said. Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd, two of the first Hollywood actresses to speak out against producer Harvey Weinstein, said for too long 'there wasn't a place' for them to report their experiences. Indeed, many feared that speaking out would jeopardize their careers. 'Why not fight back' now, McGowan said. Her friend and fellow actress Alyssa Milano said she was 'inspired' to follow McGowan's lead. She's now fighting for companies to hire more women and enforce codes of conduct. TODAY's Megyn Kelly, formerly of Fox News, said she thought maybe the culture could change for her daughter, but she 'never' thought things could change for her.

Mr. Sanders, who requested the meeting with the president, pulled into the White House grounds at 10:56 a.m. after stopping at a nearby Peet's Coffee for a scone. Mr. Obama and Mr. Sanders strolled down the colonnade next to the Rose Garden on their way into the Oval Office, chatting inaudibly and grinning broadly. Nearby, a thick line of cameras and cluster of microphones were assembled in the driveway outside the West Wing, where journalists peppered the Vermont senator with questions. Mr. Obama was trying to negotiate, however gently, with him to exit the Democratic race without inflicting damage on efforts to unite the party.

{"Key":"news208","Left":"During the solar eclipse today, President Donald Trump stepped onto the White House balcony with his wife and his son Barron, and he looked up at the sun. According to White House reporters, an aide shouted a warning that he should not look at the sun. Nevertheless, he persisted. There were parts of the United States, along path of totality, that allowed people to look directly at the eclipse. But Washington, D.C., was not among them.

But just 10 days after Scaramucci's first unofficial day and more than two weeks ahead of his official start date, Scaramucci has been removed from his post -- and Spicer appears to still work in the White House. Scaramucci will officially begin his new role on August 15, 2017. https:\/\/t.co\/KSEMiqXCEQ He was fired before his official start date -- Dan Goldberg (@DanCGoldberg) July 31, 2017 Scaramucci began to serve in the role of White House communications director on Friday, July 21, and was due to officially begin August 15. His hiring provoked the immediate resignation of Sean Spicer and the belated ousting of Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on Friday, July 28. (On Thursday, July 27, the New Yorker published reporter Ryan Lizza's account of a profanity-laced phone call he received from Scaramucci, in which Scaramucci insulted Priebus as 'a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac.') Gen. John Kelly, who had been serving as Department of Homeland Security secretary, was appointed by President Trump Friday afternoon as the new chief of staff, and on Monday, he reportedly pushed for Scaramucci's firing.

Stakeholders in the school voted earlier this month at the Jackson Public Schools Board of Trustees meeting to change the elementary school's name from Davis Magnet IB to Barack Obama Magnet IB, The Clarion-Ledger reported. 'Jefferson Davis, although infamous in his own right, would probably not be too happy about a diverse school promoting the education of the very individuals he fought to keep enslaved being named after him,' Davis Magnet IB PTA President Janelle Jefferson told the board. Jefferson said the school, where 98 percent students are black, wanted to rename the campus after Obama 'to reflect a person who fully represents ideals and public stances consistent with what we want our children to believe about themselves.'

But I don't think that it is useful or helpful for any employee anywhere to be forced to do something because the government says they must,\" Limbaugh added. Limbaugh's comments came after Trump tweeted on Wednesday suggesting NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was demanding players stand for the national anthem, following a number of players taking a knee to protest police brutality against African Americans. \"It is about time that Roger Goodell of the NFL is finally demanding that all players STAND for our great National Anthem-RESPECT OUR COUNTRY,\" Trump tweeted, in comments that prompted the NFL to issue a statement explaining Goodell had made no such demand.

Limbaugh, who has previously expressed his concern about Trump's tweets, made his feelings on the president's interference in the ongoing NFL protests clear on his show. 'There's a part of this story that's starting to make me nervous, and it's this: I am very uncomfortable with the president of the United States being able to dictate the behavior and power of anybody.

Limbaugh's comments came after Trump tweeted on Wednesday suggesting NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was demanding players stand for the national anthem, following a number of players taking a knee to protest police brutality against African Americans. 'It is about time that Roger Goodell of the NFL is finally demanding that all players STAND for our great National Anthem-RESPECT OUR COUNTRY,' Trump tweeted, in comments that prompted the NFL to issue a statement explaining Goodell had made no such demand. Several weeks ago, more than 200 NFL players knelt during the anthem, in peaceful protests that prompted ire from the president.

'That scares the hell out of me,' Limbaugh added. 'The commissioner should be demanding this. Not the president.

Alabama Senator-elect Doug Jones, D-Ala., criticized his future colleagues for 'playing political football' and not yet renewing the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), AL.com is reporting. The program is designed to help families who don't qualify for Medicaid, but have difficulty purchasing health insurance, the website noted. 'Funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program has reached a crisis level and my future colleagues must stop playing political football with the health care of our children and act now to ensure Alabama's most vulnerable do not begin losing coverage,' Jones said. 'It is absolutely unacceptable for partisan fighting to delay renewing funding for CHIP.

Alabama is the latest state to announce that it will no longer enroll children in its Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) starting January 1, 2018, and will terminate the program entirely on February 1, 2018 if Congress fails to act.\n2. The federal funding for CHIP expired on September 30, and since then, state officials have been relaying devastating news of funding shortages to families of modest incomes right around the holidays.\n3. CHIP provides low-cost health coverage to nearly nine million children nationwide, and in Alabama, it covers roughly 150,000 children, 84,000 of which are at risk of losing coverage through the state's CHIP, dubbed ALL Kids.\n4. Sixteen states that serve 4.9 million children are expected to exhaust funds by the end of January, and officials in six states have said they will end the state programs if Congress fails to reauthorize funding.\n5. Alabama Senator-elect Doug Jones criticized his future colleagues for \"playing political football\" and not yet renewing the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and urged them to act quickly to ensure that Alabama's most vulnerable children do not begin losing coverage."}

With the 1920 law back in effect, the island is now required to pay much higher costs to import supplies.

{"Key":"news1","Left":"A second federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump's decision to cancel the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, dealing another blow to the president's efforts to end protections for nearly 700,000 undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children. The nationwide preliminary injunction issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn mirrors a separate ruling handed down last month in California. Because the cancellation of DACA has already been halted, Garaufis' order won't have any immediate effect on Dreamers. But the second injunction marks a win for Trump's opponents, who have used the courts to defend DACA, even as the White House has sought to use the March 5 deadline set by the president as leverage to win concessions on border security from Democrats in Congress. It could also complicate Trump's own efforts in the courts. His administration has asked the Supreme Court to take the unusual step of overturning the first injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge William Alsup, now instead of letting it go through the normal appeals process. The Supreme Court could decide as soon as Friday whether it will hear the administration's request -- unless the new injunction delays that process.

The White House aimed to terminate the program in phases, allowing recipients whose work permits and deportation protections would expire by March 5 to apply for renewal during a four-week window, but barring all new applicants.

The modus operandi for that gig involves being more interested in making members of the mainstream media happy than pleasing one's voters. Of course, Flake and his compadres in the MSM tell a different story. In that fairy tale, Flake is being turned away by the good voters in Arizona because the GOP has changed so much under President Trump. Grab any size group of random registered Republicans in Arizona and ask about that and 90 percent of them will assure it's not true. Over the past summer, Flake easily slid into McCain's 'thorn in the side of his own party' role while Maverick was in the hospital. As his poll numbers continued to plummet and he finally made the wise choice not to seek re-election, Flake really embraced the backstabbing Republican media darling spotlight.

Jeff Flake, a Republican senator from Arizona, has thrown his support behind Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate in the Alabama special election, by donating $100 to his campaign with a tweet that read \"Country over Party.\"\n2. Flake's move is a clear break from his party, which has been grappling with how to deal with Roy Moore, the Republican candidate accused of sexual misconduct.\n3. Fellow Republican senators have distanced themselves from Moore, with some urging him to step down, but Moore has refused to do so.\n4. Republicans have struggled to find a viable option to avoid seating Moore in the Senate if he wins the election, with some suggesting he should be expelled if he does win.\n5. Flake's move is seen as a grandstanding attempt to distance himself from the Republican party and gain favor with the media."}

{"Key":"news569","Left":"The Obama administration on Friday told schools and colleges nationwide they must allow transgender students access to bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. The Justice Department and the Education Department, in guidance directed at every American public school district, admonished educators to treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity, regardless of what sex is listed on student records. The guidance, which cites the gender equity law Title IX, further injects the federal government into a heated debate over controversial anti-LGBT state legislation, including a North Carolina law that bars transgender students from bathrooms that don't match their birth gender. The Justice Department on Monday filed a civil rights lawsuit against North Carolina. \"No student should ever have to go through the experience of feeling unwelcome at school or on a college campus,\" Education Secretary John King Jr. said in a statement. King told HuffPost last week that he condemned state laws prohibiting trans students from using sex-segregated facilities like restrooms that match their gender identity.

The Justice Department and the Education Department, in guidance directed at every American public school district, admonished educators to treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity, regardless of what sex is listed on student records. The guidance, which cites the gender equity law Title IX, further injects the federal government into a heated debate over controversial anti-LGBT state legislation, including a North Carolina law that bars transgender students from bathrooms that don't match their birth gender. The Justice Department on Monday filed a civil rights lawsuit against North Carolina. 'No student should ever have to go through the experience of feeling unwelcome at school or on a college campus,' Education Secretary John King Jr. said in a statement. King told HuffPost last week that he condemned state laws prohibiting trans students from using sex-segregated facilities like restrooms that match their gender identity.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017 The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the President Trump called out the Justice Department on Monday morning for pushing a 'watered down' version of his controversial travel ban executive order, while also urging the DOJ to seek an expedited hearing in front of the Supreme Court to begin the ban's enforcement. Trump's travel ban - placing temporary restrictions on travel from several Muslim-majority countries - has been blocked by the courts since Trump signed the original executive order in January. He signed a revised travel ban in March, and that also was blocked from implementation by judges. 'People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!' Trump wrote in the first of four tweets. 'The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!' 'In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political!' A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment on Trump's tweets. Trump's tweets come in the wake of Saturday's deadly London attacks, and an increasing string of Islamist assaults around the globe. Both versions of the Trump travel ban prompted nationwide protests and fierce Democratic opposition.

During his presidential campaign, Trump called for a 'total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States' until the country could figure out what was going on. Trump's initial travel ban, signed in January 2017, sparked immediate controversy and legal challenges. The revised version, signed in March, sought to address some of the legal concerns by removing language that explicitly prioritized certain religions and adding exemptions for certain categories of travelers, such as diplomats and visa holders. However, both versions of the ban were ultimately blocked by federal judges who argued that the administration's reasoning for the ban was not sufficient to justify the restrictions on travel. The Trump administration has argued that the ban is necessary for national security, but critics have argued that it targets Muslims and violates the constitutional principle of religious freedom. The Supreme Court is currently considering whether to hear the case and has not yet issued a ruling."}

Trump administration officials are weighing the proposal as a means to prevent illegal border crossings, particularly among ones with children.","system_text":null,"response":"\ubbf8\uad6d \ub0a8\ubd80 \uad6d\uacbd \ubd88\ubc95 \uc9c4\uc785 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud574 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uce58\ub97c \ucde8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ud2b8\ub7fc\ud504 \ud589\uc815\ubd80\ub294 \ubd80\ubaa8\uc640 \uc790\ub140\uac00 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub418\ub294 \uac15\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0 \uc911\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ubcf4\ub3c4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ubc88 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \ub610\ud55c \ubbf8\uad6d\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uac70\uc8fc\ud558\uace0 \uc790\ub140\ub97c \ub370\ub9ac\uace0 \uc628 \uc774\uc8fc\ubbfc\uc5d0\uac8c \uc9d5\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ubc88 \uc870\uce58\ub294 \ubbf8\uad6d \uad6d\uacbd \uacbd\ucc30\ub300\uac00 \uc774\ub2ec \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc8fc \uacbd\ucc30 \ud65c\ub3d9 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc544\uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ubd81\ubbf8 \uc790\uc720 \ubb34\uc5ed \ud569\uc758\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud2b8\ub7fc\ud504 \ud589\uc815\ubd80\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub178\ub825\uc758 \uc77c\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\ub3c4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc774 \uc870\uce58\ub97c \uc2b9\uc778\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uae30\uac01\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac \uad6d\uac00 \uc548\ubcf4 \ubd80\uc11c \uc7a5\uad00 \ub2c8\u30fc\ub7f0 \uac00 \ub0b4\ub9b4 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc870\uce58\ub294 \ubbf8\uad6d\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uac70\uc8fc\ud558\uace0 \uc790\ub140\ub97c \ub370\ub9ac\uace0 \uc628 \uc774\uc8fc\ubbfc\uc5d0\uac8c \uc9d5\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc774\ubc88 \uac80\ud1a0\ub294 \"\uc218\ub2e8\uacfc \ubc29\ubc95 \ubaa8\uc74c\"\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c, \ubbf8\uad6d \uad6d\uacbd \uacbd\ucc30\ub300\uac00 \uc804\ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \"\uc808\ucc28\uc801, \uc815\ucc45\uc801, \uaddc\uc81c \ubc0f \ubc95\ub960\uc801\" \ubcc0\uacbd\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud574 \uc654\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\ub3c4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \"\uc774 \ud589\uc815\ubd80\ub294 \uad6d\uac00\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubc95\uc801 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ubc1d\ud614\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd94\uac00 \uc815\ucc45 \uc635\uc158\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0 \uc911\uc774\ub2e4.\"\ub77c\uace0 \ubc1d\ud614\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}

The non-binding Paris accord, through which signatories pledge to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases over the coming decades, was brokered in 2015, when the annual conference was held in the French capital.

Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest A few weeks ago, a reporter noticed that video was missing from the State Department's website and asked the agency for an explanation. A spokesman at the time dismissed the incident as a \"technical glitch,\" saying that although the video was missing the transcript was never edited and complete versions of the video still existed in other government databases available to the public. Today, spokesman John Kirby admitted the edit was made deliberately, directed by unknown persons, and executed by a staffer in the technical department. He claimed the technical staffer could not recall who had relayed the message to remove a portion of the briefing.

{"Key":"news395","Left":"Tar sands mine site in Canada. The evidence that the pipelines aren't needed is overwhelming. The idea that they would create significant numbers of jobs is laughable. The threat they represent to the environment--both directly, and indirectly--is sizable. But the money Trump was handed by pipeline promoters didn't stop at contributing to his campaign. They put big cash directly in his pocket. And now they get their reward. President Donald Trump intends to sign two executive actions today that would advance construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, according to a person familiar with the matter. For the thousands who have participated in protests leading to a reevaluation and eventual halt on these projects, this is a direct slap in the face. For Trump's backers in the oil industry, it's a big fat reward. One that will not only affect the balance of trade, and export oil jobs to Canada. Keystone XL would wipe out the U.S. trade surplus, and a hike in the price of oil to $75 or $80 a barrel would suddenly turn it to deficit. The oil for the Keystone pipeline comes from tar sands deposits in Canada that produce much more pollution than other types of oil production.","Right":"President Trump signed executive orders on Tuesday effectively reviving the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, as a major builder said it will reapply to build one of the projects which had been stalled by the Obama administration under pressure from environmental and other groups. The president said the projects would be subject to a \"renegotiation of the terms.\" But he made clear the government was resuming consideration for both pipelines, describing them as a potential boon to construction workers. \"We're going to put a lot of ... steel workers back to work,\" Trump said. \"We'll build our own pipelines, we will build our own pipes.\" Builder TransCanada said Tuesday afternoon it was \"preparing the application\" for the Keystone XL pipeline. \"We appreciate the President of the United States inviting us to re-apply for KXL,\" TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said in a statement. \"KXL creates thousands of well-paying construction jobs and would generate tens of millions of dollars in annual property taxes to counties along the route as well as more than $3 billion to the U.S. GDP,\" Cunha added. According to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Trump directed agencies to approve it without delay -- and told agencies to expedite reviews and approvals for the remaining parts of the Dakota project. \"There's an energy revolution that's going to happen in this country,\" he said.

The evidence that the pipelines aren't needed is overwhelming. The idea that they would create significant numbers of jobs is laughable. The threat they represent to the environment--both directly, and indirectly--is sizable. But the money Trump was handed by pipeline promoters didn't stop at contributing to his campaign. They put big cash directly in his pocket. And now they get their reward. President Donald Trump intends to sign two executive actions today that would advance construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, according to a person familiar with the matter. For the thousands who have participated in protests leading to a reevaluation and eventual halt on these projects, this is a direct slap in the face. For Trump's backers in the oil industry, it's a big fat reward. One that will not only affect the balance of trade, and export oil jobs to Canada. Keystone XL would wipe out the U.S. trade surplus, and a hike in the price of oil to $75 or $80 a barrel would suddenly turn it to deficit. The oil for the Keystone pipeline comes from tar sands deposits in Canada that produce much more pollution than other types of oil production. President Trump signed executive orders on Tuesday effectively reviving the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, as a major builder said it will reapply to build one of the projects which had been stalled by the Obama administration under pressure from environmental and other groups. The president said the projects would be subject to a 'renegotiation of the terms.' But he made clear the government was resuming consideration for both pipelines, describing them as a potential boon to construction workers. 'We're going to put a lot of ... steel workers back to work,' Trump said. 'We'll build our own pipelines, we will build our own pipes.' Builder TransCanada said Tuesday afternoon it was 'preparing the application' for the Keystone XL pipeline. 'We appreciate the President of the United States inviting us to re-apply for KXL,' TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said in a statement. 'KXL creates thousands of well-paying construction jobs and would generate tens of millions of dollars in annual property taxes to counties along the route as well as more than $3 billion to the U.S. GDP,' Cunha added. According to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Trump directed agencies to approve it without delay -- and told agencies to expedite reviews and approvals for the remaining parts of the Dakota project. 'There's an energy revolution that's going to happen in this country,' he said. The president also signed three other orders related to pipeline construction, including one expediting the environmental permitting process for infrastructure projects and one directing the Commerce Department to maximize the use of U.S. steel.

On Tuesday, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Kenosha Unified School District in Wisconsin violated the rights of a trans student, Ash Whitaker, when it refused to let him use the boys' bathroom. According to the court, Whitaker is likely to win upon a full review of the case (instead of the current review of a lower court's preliminary injunction) on his claim that the school's actions violated Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination in schools based on sex, and the Equal Protections Clause of the 14th Amendment. So it upheld a lower court's injunction forcing the school to let Whitaker use the bathroom that aligns with his gender identity. In the decision, a three-judge panel from the Seventh Circuit Court concluded that the school district \"has failed to provide any evidence of how the preliminary injunction will harm it, or any of its students or parents\" -- a rebuke of the prevalent myth that letting trans people use the bathroom for their gender identity will hurt others. The ruling has big implications: If existing federal law and the 14th Amendment shield trans people from discrimination, then it's not just Whitaker's rights that are protected here, but all trans students'.

And if bans against sex discrimination in particular apply to trans people, then it's not just students' rights that are protected, but all trans people who face discrimination in other settings where sex discrimination is banned The federal constitution requires that school officials submit to the demands of a teenage girl who wants to change her sex to become a boy, says a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The judges say that Kenosha Unified School District violated federal law and the Constitution because the teenager's 'gender identity' as a 'transgender boy' is more important than the popular laws, civic customs and scientific consensus which recognize that girls and boys, men and women, are biologically and socially different even as they are also complementary and legally equal. The court's ruling in Whitaker v. Kenosha likely will be sent to the U.S. Supreme Court, which will likely decide in 2018 whether the new idea of 'gender identity' will replace society's distinctions between girls and boys, and between men and women. Throughout the judges' 35-page, May 3o decision, the judges fully accepted the claim by the girl's lawyers that people can change from male to female and back again by changing their 'gender identity' and declaring themselves to be 'transgender.' So the three progressive judges also dismissed as 'sheer conjecture' the concerns by school officials that the privacy of many teenagers and children would be compromised if they are forced to share bathrooms and shower rooms with opposite-sex teenagers. The judges also confidentially insisted that 'Ash,' the teenage girl -who is not an adult -- has 'well-documented' concerns that her mental health would be damaged if school officials did not validate her claim to be a boy.

He was 77. Elizabeth Ailes, his wife, said in a statement Thursday that she was \"profoundly sad and heartbroken.\" Roger Ailes died surrounded by his family, she said. Ailes biographer Gabriel Sherman tweeted Thursday that Ailes had experienced complications from a blood clot last week while in Palm Beach, Florida. Though rarely seen in public since his downfall at Fox News, Ailes told a friend a few days ago, \"Well, if you want to know if I'm suicidal the answer is no,\" according to Sherman. Ailes is widely recognized as a media visionary who targeted an underserved segment of the population and successfully portrayed the establishment media for millions of viewers as hopelessly liberal and out of touch with their concerns. But Ailes didn't achieve cable news ratings success simply by offering an ideological alternative. He stoked fears and racial resentment, and in the post-9\/11 years, his network maligned Americans it deemed insufficiently patriotic and beat the drums of war for a Republican president. Though it declared itself \"fair and balanced\" programming, Fox News also departed at times from journalistic standards in pushing Ailes' agenda, including serving as a promotional and organizing vehicle for conservative activists against a Democratic president.

He was 77. Elizabeth Ailes, his wife, said in a statement Thursday that she was 'profoundly sad and heartbroken.' Roger Ailes died surrounded by his family, she said. Ailes biographer Gabriel Sherman tweeted Thursday that Ailes had experienced complications from a blood clot last week while in Palm Beach, Florida. Though rarely seen in public since his downfall at Fox News, Ailes told a friend a few days ago, 'Well, if you want to know if I'm suicidal the answer is no,' according to Sherman. Ailes is widely recognized as a media visionary who targeted an underserved segment of the population and successfully portrayed the establishment media for millions of viewers as hopelessly liberal and out of touch with their concerns. But Ailes didn't achieve cable news ratings success simply by offering an ideological alternative. He stoked fears and racial resentment, and in the post-9\/11 years, his network maligned Americans it deemed insufficiently patriotic and beat the drums of war for a Republican president. Though it declared itself 'fair and balanced' programming, Fox News also departed at times from journalistic standards in pushing Ailes' agenda, including serving as a promotional and organizing vehicle for conservative activists against a Democratic president. Ailes also had a reputation Roger Ailes, who built Fox News into a cable powerhouse before leaving the company last year, died Thursday morning at the age of 77. The Ohio-born television pioneer was a confidant of presidents and an acknowledged master of communications. He founded Fox News in 1996 and built it into the nation's long-running No. 1 cable news network. Ailes resigned from Fox in July amid charges of sexual harassment. His widow, Elizabeth Ailes, confirmed the news in a statement.

'Roger was a loving husband to me, to his son Zachary, and a loyal friend to many. He was also a patriot, profoundly grateful to live in a country that gave him so much opportunity to work hard, to rise--and to give back.' The Associated Press quoting the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's Office said Ailes died of complications from a fall at his home on May 10. 'Roger and I shared a big idea which he executed in a way no one else could have. In addition, Roger was a great patriot who never ceased fighting for his beliefs.' - Rupert Murdoch Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of 21st Century Fox and Fox News Channel, said he was saddened by the development.

'Roger's passing is a huge loss for our company and for everybody in the media business.'\n\nAiles was born on May 15, 1940, in Warren, Ohio, and worked as a political consultant and media strategist before starting Fox News in 1996. He was widely credited with helping to shape the careers of Republican presidents, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and was known for his aggressive and sometimes controversial approach to politics and media.\n\nIn July 2016, Ailes was forced to resign from Fox News following a wave of sexual harassment allegations that were made against him by several female employees. The scandal led to a major overhaul of the network, with many top executives and on-air personalities leaving the company in the weeks and months that followed.\n\nDespite his fall from grace, Ailes remained a powerful figure in American media and politics, and his influence on the conservative movement and the Republican Party was widely felt. His death was widely mourned by political leaders and media figures across the country, with many paying tribute to his contributions to American journalism and political discourse."}

The missile on Sunday reached an altitude of more than 1,245 miles during its 30-minute flight time, the Japanese government said. That data, combined with the announcement by South Korea that the projectile covered a distance of 430 miles, showed that it was an intermediate-range ballistic missile that could target key United States military bases in the Pacific, including those in Guam, missile experts said. The North's launch took place as its biggest supporter, China, was hosting delegations from around the world at its 'One Belt One Road' forum in Beijing. A North Korean delegation, led by its external trade minister, was also attending. President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin, who was at the forum, had a 'fairly detailed talk' about the situation of the Korean Peninsula, including the North's missile test, said Mr. Putin's spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. 'Mutual concern was expressed about how this situation is developing, and about growing tensions,' Mr. Peskov said. Hours after President Trump's comment, Russia's Defense Ministry said the North Korean missile posed 'no danger' to Russia because The White House responded to the latest North Korean ballistic missile launch late Saturday, saying that the rogue regime has been a 'flagrant menace for far too long.' The statement added that President Trump 'cannot imagine that Russia is pleased' with North Korea's latest test because the missile landed close to Russia soil. The statement pointed out that the missile landed closer to Russia than to Japan. The White House said the U.S. maintains its 'ironclad commitment' to stand with its allies in the face of the serious threat posed by North Korea, and added that the latest 'provocation' should serve as a call for all nations to implement far stronger sanctions against the North. The Pentagon confirmed that North Korea launched some type of ballistic missile at around 10:30 a.m. Hawaii time. It was launched near Kusung and landed in the Sea of Japan. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America. South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported the missile traveled about 435 miles. The launch is the first in two weeks since the last attempt to fire a missile ended in a failure just minutes into flight. The isolated regime attempted but failed to test-launch ballistic missiles four consecutive times in the past two months but has conducted a variety of missile testing since the beginning of last year at fast pace. Trump warned in an interview with Reuters in late April that a 'major, major conflict' with the North","system_text":null,"response":"\ubbf8\uad6d\uacfc \ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544\ub294 \ucf5c\ub4dc \uc6cc \uc2dc\ub300\uc758 \ub3d9\ub9f9\uad6d\uc774\uc5c8\ub358 \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d\uacfc \uba40\ud2f0\ub098\uc158 \ud68c\ub2f4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \ud3ec\ub7fc\uc740 2003\ub144\ubd80\ud130 \uc2dc\uc791\ub418\uc5b4 \uc9c0\ub09c 2008\ub144 \uc774\ud6c4\ub85c \ub9c8\ube44\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc120\uc694\uc77c \uc800\ub141, \ubbf8\uad6d \uc720\uc5d4 \ub300\ud45c \ub2c8\ud0a4 \ud5e4\uc77c\ub9ac\ub294 \ud2b8\uc704\ud130 \uac8c\uc2dc\ubb3c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub0a0 \ubc1c\uc0ac\ub97c \ube44\ub09c\ud558\uba70 \ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544\ub97c \uc5b8\uae09\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubcf8 \uc815\ubd80\ub294 \uc774\ub0a0 \ubbf8\uc0ac\uc77c\uc774 1,245\ub9c8\uc77c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uace0\ub3c4\ub97c \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\uba70 30\ubd84 \ub3d9\uc548 \ube44\ud589\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1d\ud614\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d\uc774 \uc0ac\ub791 430\ub9c8\uc77c\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1d\ud614\uc744 \ub54c, \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774 \ubbf8\uc0ac\uc77c\uc774 \uc911\uac70\ub9ac \uc804\ub7b5\ubbf8\uc0ac\uc77c\uc774\uba70, \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc640 \uad0c\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ud0dc\ud3c9\uc591\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubbf8\uad6d \uad70\uc0ac \uae30\uc9c0\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0ac\ub294 \uc911\uad6d, \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uad6d\uc774 \ubca0\uc774\uc9d5\uc5d0\uc11c '\uc77c\ub300\uc77c\ub85c' \ud3ec\ub7fc\uc744 \uac1c\ucd5c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc804 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ub300\ud45c\ub2e8\uc774 \ucc38\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc744 \ub54c\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544\ub294 \uc774\ub0a0 \uc77c\ubcf8 \ub545\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uac70\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0ac\ub41c \ubbf8\uc0ac\uc77c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \ud45c\uba85\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub0a0 \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d\uc740 \ud55c\ubc18\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ube14\ub77c\ub514\ubbf8\ub974 \ud478\ud2f4 \ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544 \ub300\ud1b5\ub839\uacfc \ub300\ub2f4\uc744 \ub098\ub234\ub2e4\uace0 \ubc1d\ud614\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}

{"Key":"news340","Left":"Thousands of people marched in cities around the country to demand that President Trump release his tax returns on Tax Day, in a demonstration that echoed the 2009 tax rallies that launched the Tea Party movement. Saturday's Tax March, which took place in nearly 200 cities around the country, was unusual for a liberal protest both in its subject matter and its specificity: rather than focus on more typically leftist issues like police brutality, climate change or reproductive rights, the Tax March was all about taxes, which is typically a rallying cry of Republicans. Specifically, the marchers had just one demand: to see Trump's taxes. Most of the protests were largely conflict-free, but at least a dozen demonstrators were arrested in Berkeley after a pro-Trump demonstration resulted in a fistfight against counter-demonstrators, punctuated with pepper and smoke bombs. It did not appear to be related to the Tax March. The March took place exactly eight years after the first major Tea Party rally to protest Obama policies on April 15, 2009, which was widely credited as the beginning of the far-right Tea Party movement. Saturday's Tax March was superficially similar to that first Tea Party in some ways: many of the protesters were older than the millennials who flocked to earlier anti-Trump rallies, and there were more conspicuous displays of patriotism than one normally sees at liberal rallies. Older people generally tend to care more about tax issues, and the Tea Party was made up mostly of older Americans: three-quarters of self-identified Tea Party members are","Right":"Thousands of protesters turned out Saturday in events across the country to demand President Trump release his full IRS returns, mostly large-but-peaceful events with several arrests reported in California. That the events were held on the deadline for hundreds of millions of Americans to file their federal returns was largely coincidental. Their intent was to pressure Trump to release his tax documents and to help Trump opponents stake out their position ahead of the president's pending tax reform plan. \"Today, across American we are taking the gloves off to say it's time to knock off the tax rip-off,\" Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden told a crowd of several hundred people gathered at the base of Capitol Hill. \"No more Cayman Islands tax breaks ... no more Wall Street tax breaks,\" he roared before the crowd marched several miles to the National Mall. \"It's time to knock off the secrecy Mr. President and release your own tax returns.\" TRUMP WON'T RELEASE TAX RETURNS Twenty people were reportedly arrested when Trump protesters clashed with supporters in Berkley, Calif.

Saturday's Tax March, which took place in nearly 200 cities around the country, was unusual for a liberal protest both in its subject matter and its specificity: rather than focus on more typically leftist issues like police brutality, climate change or reproductive rights, the Tax March was all about taxes, which is typically a rallying cry of Republicans. Specifically, the marchers had just one demand: to see Trump's taxes. Most of the protests were largely conflict-free, but at least a dozen demonstrators were arrested in Berkeley after a pro-Trump demonstration resulted in a fistfight against counter-demonstrators, punctuated with pepper and smoke bombs. It did not appear to be related to the Tax March. The March took place exactly eight years after the first major Tea Party rally to protest Obama policies on April 15, 2009, which was widely credited as the beginning of the far-right Tea Party movement. Saturday's Tax March was superficially similar to that first Tea Party in some ways: many of the protesters were older than the millennials who flocked to earlier anti-Trump rallies, and there were more conspicuous displays of patriotism than one normally sees at liberal rallies. Older people generally tend to care more about tax issues, and the Tea Party was made up mostly of older Americans: three-quarters of self-identified Tea Party members are Thousands of protesters turned out Saturday in events across the country to demand President Trump release his full IRS returns, mostly large-but-peaceful events with several arrests reported in California. That the events were held on the deadline for hundreds of millions of Americans to file their federal returns was largely coincidental. Their intent was to pressure Trump to release his tax documents and to help Trump opponents stake out their position ahead of the president's pending tax reform plan. 'Today, across American we are taking the gloves off to say it's time to knock off the tax rip-off,' Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden told a crowd of several hundred people gathered at the base of Capitol Hill. 'No more Cayman Islands tax breaks ... no more Wall Street tax breaks,' he roared before the crowd marched several miles to the National Mall. 'It's time to knock off the secrecy Mr. President and release your own tax returns.' TRUMP WON'T RELEASE TAX RETURNS Twenty people were reportedly arrested when Trump protesters clashed with supporters in Berkley, Calif.

{"Key":"news347","Left":"Video TANTA, Egypt -- Rattling a country already wrestling with a faltering economy and deepening political malaise, two suicide bombings that killed 44 people at Coptic churches in Egypt on Palm Sunday raised the specter of increased sectarian bloodshed led by Islamic State militants. The attacks constituted one of the deadliest days of violence against Christians in Egypt in decades and presented a challenge to the authority of the country's leader, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who promptly declared a three-month state of emergency. Security is the central promise of Mr. Sisi, a strongman leader who returned on Friday from a triumphant visit to the United States, where President Trump hailed him as a bulwark against Islamist violence. Mr. Trump made it clear that he was willing to overlook the record of mass detention, torture and extrajudicial killings during Mr. Sisi's rule in favor of his ability to combat the Islamic State and defend minority Christians.

The attacks constituted one of the deadliest days of violence against Christians in Egypt in decades and presented a challenge to the authority of the country's leader, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who promptly declared a three-month state of emergency. Security is the central promise of Mr. Sisi, a strongman leader who returned on Friday from a triumphant visit to the United States, where President Trump hailed him as a bulwark against Islamist violence. Mr. Trump made it clear that he was willing to overlook the record of mass detention, torture and extrajudicial killings during Mr. Sisi's rule in favor of his ability to combat the Islamic State and defend minority Christians.

A second explosive device was left at a different metro station but did not detonate. Police initially said the device had been left on the train by the attacker, and that a search was under way for two people suspected of organising and carrying out the attack. Later, however, the Interfax news agency claimed the blast had in fact been caused by a suicide bomber, citing a law enforcement source, but there was no immediate confirmation of this. The explosion occurred at around 2.30pm local time on Monday, after the train had left Sennaya Ploshchad station in the centre of St Petersburg.
